More than religion, then, Hinduism is a spiritual-culture that lacks the formal structures of what the West expects in religion.\nTo the OPs point though, Hinduism is really really really complicated, especially when you consider that it has been turned over by both the growth and fall of Indian Buddhism and the conquest of the area by Islamic regimes through the middle of the 2nd millennium."], "type": ["COMMENT"]}

Only against him do not stretch out your hand.\u201d\nThe rest of the chapter goes on to tell about how Satan tests Job's faith in God by taking away all that he has. By no means is Satan \"God's little undercover boss\" -- in fact, New Testament theology uniformly acknowledges Satan as the \"prince of this world\" (\n), that Satan is directly opposed to God and has power over humans while we still live on this earth.

Not even kidding.\n is one of the most common microbes in the world - an enterobacterium that coats the root system of every single plant we've ever tested. It's involved in the natural decomposition process, which it does with great diligence. The boffins recognised this and thought it'd be a nice candidate microbe to solve a problem of ours - how to get rid of decomposing agricultural waste. The method used by farmers was to simply burn the stuff; which not only releases plant pathogens into the air, but also wasn't great for their health nor the environment. Perhaps we could do something better than that. \nCue the bioengineering! The scientists thought they could use this bacterium that feeds on waste to not only get rid of it, but produce something useful - fuel in the form of alcohol! The idea was for farmers to dump their waste into vats containing the engineered alcohol-producing bacteria, to produce ethanol via fermentation (supposedly killing the bacteria in the process), and use the additional nitrogenous sludge waste as fertiliser. Just in case the bacteria survived the fermentation, tests were undertaken on soil samples and no harmful effects were encountered. What they forgot was that the soil samples were sterile and weren't representative of any real agricultural field.\nHad it not been for the fact that one PhD student, who got their hands on the bacterium and tested it on a natural soil sample, this beastie might have been released. This student, however, in the nick of time, found out that the bacteria \n survive fermentation, \n get into the fertiliser, and had it gotten out into the fields, would have immediately started producing alcohol around the roots of the crop plants.\nThis kills the plants. And when the plants die, they provide more food for the bacteria to eat, multiply and spread. And as the bacteria are naturally associated with the roots of all plants on Earth, they would have very rapidly been able to proliferate and destroy all plant matter across the globe.\nEverything, every green thing on the planet, killed by alcohol poisoning.\nAnd we were saved by this one PhD student.\n if you're curious for more.\n The entire planet's biosphere was once saved from a plant-killing bacterial monster, by an unnamed PhD student."], "type": ["COMMENT"]}

Starting talking more. Then we hung out on and off, as friends. Anyways, we ended up having mediocre drunk sex on his twin bed after a music festival. He's got an long-term on-again-off-again affair and I didn't really want to be caught up in that, but we're still good friends."], "type": ["COMMENT"]}

They get it on, and have lots of spirit babies. These spirits cannot transcend unless they go through life on Earth first, so it's the duty of good mormon couples to have as many children as they can, to house as many spirits as possible. A successful mormon family, is one with 4 or more children, because they are doing their heavenly duty.\nOnce the spirits have lived life on Earth, if they have lived it righteously, they can then become Gods of their own planets, and so they become a Heavenly Father, and their wife that they were sealed to in the temple (whole different topic) becomes a Heavenly Mother, and they have a bunch of spirit babies that need to go down to Earth so they can transcend. It is a never ending cycle, and this is why there is such disdain to mormon couples who either wait to have children or can't have (enough) children. They are seen as not living life righteously, and being very selfish for not helping spirit babies transcend to their own godliness.\nSource: I have lived in UT for the last six years, and have picked up a thing or two.\nPS.

History has also seen murderous clowns, like this French one tha murdered a boy in the 1800s (?). John Wayne Gacy, nortorious serial killer, used to dress up as a clown named Pogo for children's parties. Of course, not all clowns are scary, Ronald McDonald for example. And Victorian clowns used to throw candy at children. But this new clown phobia basically boils down to two fears: pedophiles and artificial appearance they have. Since \"stranger danger\" started, parents apparently question why a dude would want to dress up and entertain children. Because he must be a pedophile if he wants to be a clown! Also despite the fun looking makeup, you're never sure what the person under all that makeup is feeling. He could be hungover despite the giant red smile he has painted on. So, yeah, clowns like Pennywise in IT or these clowns that are running around now are just building on this fear people have had for a while.

It played on his patriotism and his desire to do great works, and twisted it.

The argument I've always been told is \"It excuses them from actually doing anything to help!\". Well, no, not really. The Bible very strongly encourages people to do good works. There are a ton of verses that tell the reader to perform charity, donate to causes, and help people without expecting anything in return. Praying is not an excuse not to help. If someone says \"I'll pray for you, but sorry I can't help you fundraise/cook you a meal/generally donate my time and or money\" it's because they're a lazy asshole, not because the praying is a magic \"don't have to do anything\" card. Another point I'd like to make is that for a truly religious person, praying \n. They truly believe that praying on your behalf will bring your issues to God's attention and He'll help you out. My uncle, who is a pastor, once told me that God appreciates it when you pray for other people rather than yourself, but I'm not sure if that's a universal thing with Christianity. So when someone prays for you, they are genuinely trying to help, and genuinely think it will improve your life, even if you don't believe that. Unless it's some obnoxious old lady who's throwing passive aggressive shade at your lifestyle, people who offer to pray for you have genuinely good intentions. So even if you don't believe in the power of pray, please just thank them and then ask them if they can donate their time to help you. A Christian who is genuinely your friend will be happy to cook you a meal or clean your house or watch your kids after they've sent up a prayer for you."], "type": ["COMMENT"]}

And the one thing a parent doesn't do is micromanage every aspect of their child's life. If a parent wants their child to grow up and be self sufficient and independent - which is what all parents should want - then they have to step back and let the child figure things out for themselves. They have to let them make mistakes and do things on their own, discover their own talents, and create their own accomplishments. A parent can and should guide and help the child, but they shouldn't control or micromanage their child. And that's what I believe God has done - He's taken a step back and told humanity \"It's your turn now. Spread your wings and fly\". Praying draws His attention to someone who needs a little help, who can't do it on their own. So He can guide and encourage them, or not do that (which I interpret as Him saying \"You can do it, I know you can. Do you want to get up and try again? Come on, show Daddy that you know how to do it\"). My belief is that praying is essentially a distress signal - an \"I give up, I need help Dad!\" He's probably already aware of the problems and is letting the person fix it on their own, as a good father should. Once you throw in the towel and start praying, that's when He comes in and helps."], "type": ["COMMENT"]}

I used to sell shoes as a part time job in high school, and aside from basic customer service skills, the jobs don't have a lot in common. In the B2B world, we have relatively rational and informed customers (though of course there are exceptions). They take pricing and negotiating less personally because the money is coming out of their employer's pocket, not their own. Building a long-term relationship with a vendor or account manager has real value to the client, because it means they receive products and services tailored to their specific needs without spending a lot of time bringing a new provider up to speed. \nA car salesman, for example, has to fight to sell as much as possible to the client on the spot, because that client probably only buys one car every 3-5 years, if that. You can't convince them of the need for a second vehicle, so your only upsell options are trim levels and service packages and extended warranties that the buyer can do without. It's not an ongoing business relationship. You're not establishing trust and credibility to increase the probability of selling something more substantial when they need it. I love the dealership where I got my Nissan. I love the car itself. The salesperson was professional and respectful (which is depressingly rare for young female car shoppers) and did minimal upselling. I get it serviced there, and I recommend them to others. However, I bought that car nine years ago, and I have no near-term plans to replace it. The sales department has a very satisfied customer, but no additional revenue to show for it. I think it's shitty, but I understand the urge to push all the extra bells and whistles when you're in that position."], "type": ["COMMENT"]}

That was the start of a conversation that lasted the entire flight, with both of us typing on my computer, I in English, she in Spanish. Unfortunately the wi-fi didn't last forever, y m\u00ed Espa\u00f1ol es muy malo, but it was a really nice conversation while it lasted. I found out that she was a tango dancer. She liked music as well. And she was very sweet. I wish I found a way to contact her, because now I'll never see her again. But google translate. It has become so good.

And what people don't realize is that the manager has to answer to the general manager. Best advice I can give is to go in on the last day of the month when the weather is HORRIBLE. I'm talking snow storm/rain. Anything that causes slow business is a great opportunity for customers. \nANOTHER thing people should know is- online pricing on used is usually the lowest price since it brings in traffic from all over the state/country. I've had people fly in from 3 states away to buy bc of the online price. \nAlso, new car pricing online is with all rebates applied. So when you show up and don't qualify for rebates don't boohoo. You should've read that on the same page as the low price. \nSalesman is the best position at a dealership bc you work the least hours (55 hrs+) and can potentially make more than your managers and general manager.\nManagers get fired all the time and work 70 hrs weekly. \nAny other questions just ask. And give your next salesman a break- they are fighting with you then fighting with managers to make a measly 100$ which they won't even see bc they can't cover their draw.\nFrom what I have learned I would go into a dealership and ask for the salesman with the most product knowledge-guaranteed nerd- who makes shit paychecks for the dealership but can set up your hands free Bluetooth in a jiffer.

That is very reasonable.  I'm talking about people well into their careers, and careers that involve accounting and taxes sometimes.  \nThe reason this is true is because the higher tax rates are only applied to the income that is higher than the bracket cutoffs.  So no matter what you eventually earn, the first 10K you earn is taxed at 10%, the next 35K is taxed at 15%, the next 60K is taxed at 25% and so on.  (all numbers and %'s are rough estimates) So, when you just squeak into the new tax bracket by $1,000, only that $1,000 is taxed at the higher rate, not all of your income.  \nTaxes aren't withheld this way from your paycheck because those are based on expected annual income.  I think that is part of what confuses people, along with how complicated taxes can be in total.  In general though, earning more money will never mean you actually take home less.

They take out this little buzzer and buzz her awake. I could literally feel her jump and twitch, and her heart rate immediately increased by a lot. You could hear it thumping away on the monitor, poor thing. :(\nEdit: To clear some things up, I fully realize the buzzer isn't meant to be some medieval torture device for unborn children. It's the same concept as picking up your newborn baby while she's deeply asleep and startling her awake on accident. There's no harm done, and the baby is over it in a split second, but in that moment you feel bad because you startled them out of sleep. That's all. The test is a good thing. It looks for healthy reactivity and monitors the heart rate of the baby to make sure all is well, so totally necessary and definitely safe."], "type": ["COMMENT"]}

Hurrah! Some of those being:\n Also known as Guinea Worm Disease, it's caused by these teeny weeny nematode worms that can invade your body after you drink water filled with infected copepods (which the worm larvae get into). Once that copepod hits yo' stomach acid, it dissolves, releasing the worm into your system - where they travel around, banging one another and generally making a mess. Eventually the females make their way to your skin and burst their way out over the course of several weeks - idea is they wanna' dump their eggs into water, so that other copepods can get infected, which someone else will then drink. The circle of life moves us all.\nThere's no drug to kill them off nor vaccine to prevent; if you get them, you get them. The only way to remove 'em is to wait until they start poking out of your skin. Once that happens, you can grab that end, wrap it around a matchstick or similar, and slowly wind it out over the course of several days (you can't directly pull, otherwise they'd snap and scarper back, or otherwise get stuck and rot away inside somewhere). \n.\nThankfully, an eradication programme is ongoing, and we've gotten the number of annual cases down to \n (from near 900,000 in the late '80s). Another few years and that nematode parasite will be gone for good, hurrah!\n We've already eliminated two strains, now let's go for the hat-trick! For those unaware, polio is a viral disease, transmitted human-to-human, which, in a small number of cases, can lead to permanent paralysis. Eek! On the brighter side, \n, down from several hundreds of thousands a few decades ago. True, it's not been easy progress, and a whole loada' opposition arose which slowed the process down - to give an example of one of many anti-vaccine movements, many Pakistani people thought the WHO immunisation campaign was a cover for US-led forced sterilisation post-9/11, going so far as to incite killings of many aid workers. To those who remained out in the field to eradicate the disease, despite the high tensions around it in some parts of the world, I salute you.\nAlas, now, thanks to their brave efforts, there's no doubt it will be gone in a few years. Woop, woop.\n Few people seem to have ever heard of this one. Caused by a bacterium, initial symptoms start as warty-like lesions on the skin (\n), which spread and get progressively worse over time. After a quiet period, the infection can eventually heads inwards (in about 10% of cases), causing destruction of bone, cartilage and soft tissue - so basically your face kinda' collapses. I'm not adding a photo 'cos I just googled for some, remembered it's nightmare fuel and insta' noped out. Fuck. Poor people.\nThough the eradication programme \n, I suspect by 2026 we'll see it coming to a close.\n\u00a0\nSo there we go, a few diseases who's first two words on their Wiki page should soon become as powerful as \n.

Two things come to mind. \nIf you don't ask whether the price will go up in the 2nd year or whatever, the salesperson is not obligated to tell you if it will. We put you on an information diet. It will be in the contract that you sign, and it's up to you to read that. This is why people say you should always do research on what questions to ask, whether you're buying earbuds or a house. One time I had a customer ask me over the phone \n You think I can do anything about it at that point? The answer was yes, it was going to go up, but I wasn't about to get screamed at pointlessly, so I just changed the subject. \nThe second one isn't exactly a trick, but sometimes while chatting with a customer, they would tell me personal information that led me to believe that signing a 2-year contract was not a good financial decision for them at that time.

At this point, I'd be surprised if other businesses haven't adopted this little technique.\nGoDaddy's tech support line would connect you to someone who was fully capable of fixing about 80% of the possible problems you might face and could quickly and easily escalate the other 20% to a more advanced and capable team.\nThat 80% of problems could be resolved with just a few clicks and keystrokes on my (the tech support end) but I'm going to put you on hold because \"its going to take me a few minutes to resolve your issue, I'll be as quick as possible.\"  What I'm really doing while your on hold is looking over your account information.  I was looking for the best product angle to sell you on.  Your issue took me seconds to fix, but I had you wait for a few minutes while I figured out the best strategy to get you to buy more stuff based on your current purchases and business history with GoDaddy.  It could be something as simple as noticing your hosting subscription was about to expire and offering to renew it for you right then and there, or offering you \"common mispellings\" of your current domain name.  \nThe real kicker here is how \n this was.  When I started I was told I needed to sell a minimum of $1500 of product a week if I wanted to get comission (which was a bonus to the already hourly rate of $14/hr) and only  if less than half of my sales total could be domain name sales for it to count.  I didn't think I'd ever see commission cause I'd been in plenty of sales positions before and moving $1500 a week when the average price per product is $10-$15 was not going to be easy.\nI was so wrong.  I was hitting 3-5k in sales each week and it was the easiest sales I've ever done in my life.  Trust was built in because I was fixing a problem you called to get fixed.  Product was cheap and appropriately valued.  I was hyper-informed, I knew exactly what to sell you...misfires were rare.  And to top it all off, existing customer's credit card info was stored on their account so I just had to ask which card they wanted to use...no need to tell me anything about your card info, making it even easier for customers to say \"Yeah, go ahead.\""], "type": ["COMMENT"]}

I've never seen it myself, I only read about it in the book Dead Wake by Erik Larson. He described the body as follows:\n\"The most unsettling image here is that of Body No. 156, a girl of about three, slightly chubby, with curly blond hair, wearing a pullover sweater with overlong sleeves. What is troubling is the child's expression. She looks perturbed. Someone laid flowers across her chest and at her side, but she seems unmollified. She lies on a wood pallet, beside what appears to be a life jacket. Her expression is one of pure fury.\"\nI tried googling it because I too had a morbid curiosity, but to no avail. I suspect the picture only exists in archives and was never digitized and uploaded online, unfortunately for us.

When their request was denied, the Teutonic women slew their own children. The next morning, all the women were found dead in each other's arms, having strangled each other during the night. This act passed into Roman legends of Teutonic fury.\nSource: "], "type": ["COMMENT"]}

But I wanted it now, because I'd just moved and couldn't find the wifi dongle for my desktop. I would pay a few bucks extra for that convenience.\nNot one physical store sold them for less than $1/foot. Around 3 times what I'd pay if I were willing to wait a day. Even fucking Wal-Mart whose logistics chain might be even better than Amazon's and so doesn't have that as an excuse.\nYeah, it's sad when local stores die off because they lose too much business online, and then you can't go in and physically compare items to choose, but I can't bring myself to feel bad when they're pricing themselves out of business. And when it comes to chain stores, I give even less of a shit. Best Buy might as well rename themselves to the Amazon Showroom, that's all anyone I know uses them for anymore.\nEdit because I'm getting a lot of responses on these two points:"], "type": ["COMMENT"]}

Taking more time to buy something will get you a better price.  2. Go ahead and make life inconvenient for the salesman if it makes things easy for you.  (EDIT: part 3) 3. Ask for the price early and often.\nONE.  Being willing to spend a bit more time thinking before you respond will neutralize about half of a good salesman's tactics, and almost all the ones used by a novice.  \nWant to let the sales guys know you worked in communications/sales/advertising/industry psych/read part of Freakonomics etc?  Respond to questions with \"I need a minute to think about that,\" and be willing to walk away, wait an hour, or come back tomorrow.  \nIf you're willing to spend the value of your time, you can get the price you want.  Conversely, people who spend more are essentially paying for the convenience of getting through the sale quickly and with minimal effort, even if they don't realize it.\nTWO.  Salesmen are economically motivated to reach out to you and make things as nice for you as possible.  Don't worry about inconveniencing us.  You don't need to apologize for not calling back in a timely manner, or for taking up our time and not actually buying anything.  It's our job to make you excited about buying a thing, because you are paying for the experience too.\nTHREE.  Nothing is more likely to derail a sales pitch than someone asking the price too early, before I have a chance to build an emotional connection or an appreciation of the value of the product.  By asking for prices up-front, you neutralize a lot of emotional tactics designed to make you feel like the product is worth more.\nHandling this situation with aplomb is also a mark of an experienced salesman.  Go to a car dealership - the whole experienced is constructed so that no one talks specifics about price until you have decided on a car.  Once you have committed to a very specific product, you lose a lot of leverage because the salesman knows you won't get what you want if you switch to a cheaper option.  Don't let the salesman control the experience.  And per suggestion 1, the more time you spend negotiating, the better you will do.  "], "type": ["COMMENT"]}

This places completely ridiculous amounts of strain force onto the roots of the hair at the front of the head, which makes it far more likely to fall out. Women don't have this problem because a) its not pulled so tight, and b) there is far more hair in the bun portion so that even if the hair tie is to slide along a bit (away from the scalp) during the day, the wearer isn't going to notice so much, which also further relieves tension.\nNot only does it impact the rate of hairline recession, it also increases it's prominence.

Sally is one of the coolest, sweetest, most talented people i have ever had the privilege of meeting. but her parents are the worst people ever. I'm only 16 and i feel like i could raise a kid better than these assholes. First off, theyre highly abusive. emotionally and physically. They also have horrible anger issues. whenever theyre angry, they take their anger out on sally, whether it be yelling at her (\n) for something little she did, insulting her (calling her fat, ugly, etc. these things arent even true,) or hitting her for something as simple as forgetting to put a fork in the dishwasher. it's awful. Another thing this girl's parents do is treat her like a slave. They are the laziest people i have ever met in my life. they literally do nothing. her mother barely even works ffs. neither one of them do house work. or yard work. or even cook dinner. Sally does it all. shes even forced to make their bed. THEY CANT EVEN MAKE THEIR OWN BED. and if she makes the smallest mistake, she gets screamed at for being a horrible daughter, for not being good at anything, etc. her mother barely even drives. no matter what, sally has to drive. shes forced to drive everywhere. theyre also very... controlling? they dont let sally do anything with anyone. she barely gets to go out with her friends and I. They also treat her like a child, they wont even let her have her phone in her room. they take it from her every night before bed. (but i was a good friend and supplied her with an old phone she can use at night) Lastly, they're bible bumping, LGBT hating, racist, southern trash. and i wont even get into the things they say about gay, black, muslim, trans, etc, people because it's just too much. and sad honestly."], "type": ["COMMENT"]}

The flea circus scene in the book and movie, the dwarf pygmy elephant scene in the book, the admission that most sources of dino DNA are too degraded in the book and movie, there's a lot of hints that Hammond is continuing his huckster style. The main plot has them visiting the island for a safety check, but what do a paleontologist and paleobotanist know about safety checks? If Hammond can fool them, he can fool anyone.\nNot to mention the real-world problems with using preserved mosquitos as a DNA source and the changing nature of dinosaur knowledge (no feathers, when we now think they did have them. Nice try to retcon, \n, I ain't buyin' it).\nEdit: That is, the \"dinosaurs\" we see in Jurassic Park have virtually no actual dinosaur DNA, but were heavily genetically modified versions of other base creatures that we do have DNA access to. Hammond admits twice (in the novel) to tricking people into seeing what they want to see - in once case, where a mechanized circus with no fleas has children claiming to see the fleas, and in another, where a natural pygmy elephant with dwarfism was used to demonstate the powers of genetic engineering (by heavily implying it was itself the result of genetic engineering). The \"dinosaurs\" in Jurassic park were the ultimate extension of this - animals with no actual dinosaur DNA, but engineered to fool people into believing they \n actual dinosaurs."], "type": ["COMMENT"]}

He then has a mental breakdown and ends up becoming the Joker. \n It's a couple years from now, the chips are on the line, the multiverse is at stake, again... only this time it all comes down to Batman. \nHe defeats the ultimate evil of the DC universe, only to find himself launched through time... into a strangely familiar city. \nScrambling to find some clothes after his costume got destroyed by Z-rays in the epic final battle, he nabs some threads off a low-hanging clothesline. He leaves his bat-wallet full of cash on the windowsill... he's not a bad guy, after all.\nJust then, he sees a family of three emerge from the alley nearby. With a strange sense of deja vu, Bruce recognizes... his mother and father, and his childhood self. This is the night Bruce's parents were murdered! Bruce whirls around, looking for the culprit, \"Joe Chill,\" but the only people there are himself and the Waynes. They barely glance at the ragged figure as they start to walk past.\nWith a spike of cold horror, Bruce realizes that in its final death throes, the ultimate evil he had faced in the future sent him backwards through time for a very specific reason. Color draining from his face, Bruce reaches a hand into the borrowed coat's pocket... to find a dense, metallic lump. Drawing it out of the pocket, he comes face to face with a snub-nosed revolver.\nA flash of terrible insight comes to Bruce along with an iron certainty. Without Batman, the universe would never survive the ultimate evil. Without this night, there is no Batman. This is his only chance... he must choose: break his one rule (to never kill), or be complicit in the assured annihilation of the universe. There is no real choice.\nWith tears streaming down his face, he remembers with trained photographic memory the hollow words the mugger spat at the elder Waynes. They turn, startled. As if his hands had minds of their own, he feels the pressure on his fingers as he slowly and inexorably... pulls the trigger.\nBruce Wayne has killed his parents in order to save everything else.\nIn a blind haze, Bruce the elder stumbles from the alley as Bruce the younger wails into the night. Nearing the Narrows Bridge, Bruce's mind begins to crumble under the weight of what he has just done to himself. Unable to bear the maddening maelstrom of conflicting grief and certainty, he climbs to the highest point of the Bridge, looks out over the long-suffering city, and jumps without looking into the icy depths a hundred feet below.\nLater that night, dockworkers pull a body from the water. No ID, no wallet. Nothing in the pockets but a gun and lint. Broken, deathly pale... but alive. As the foreman hangs up the call to the cops, he almost swears he hears something from the body. It sounds almost like... laughter.\nIt is the laughter of a man who knows the funniest joke in the world, but just can't quite remember the punchline."], "type": ["COMMENT"]}
