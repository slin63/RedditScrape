Before I realized that I had some symptoms of schizophrenia, I thought that the voices were coming from people around me. It made me feel paranoid in public places, and I stayed in my room for as long as I could on most days. The voices began threatening me, saying that terrible things would happen to me, because of my thoughts and actions. I was so scared that I would try to force myself to sleep, just to avoid thinking.\nI spent some time in the hospital, and I saw people who were experiencing worse symptoms than I was. I learned just how terrible schizophrenia can be. I used to be constantly on edge, trying to control all of my thoughts so the voices wouldn't yell at me. Then, I started taking medication and going to therapy. I've stopped smoking weed, and I haven't heard any voices in months.\nA silver lining that I can take from the experience is that it made me a better person. The voices were so critical of my thoughts and actions, that I changed my personality so there wasn't anything for them to criticize me for. I became less self-absorbed. I learned to be appreciative of everything I have in life. I've also adopted a more optimistic outlook on life, because I've experienced such a depressing and scary low point. I wouldn't wish psychosis on anyone, but for those struggling with schizophrenia...Take some time to get help, listen to your doctors, get engaged in therapy, and remain hopeful that you will get better."], "type": ["COMMENT"]}

Great to hear how well it turned out for you there.\nI have a friend who will take a turn similar to yours if he isn't careful.  He smokes a ton of weed, takes all kinds of other hard drugs.  We went to a festival recently with another friend and after taking MDMA and then smoking weed at the end of the night he went super, super paranoid.  Delirious in fact.  I'm sure he was hallucinating too.  It absolutely scared the living daylights out of me and our friend at the time.  Happened the following night too.  \nHe still takes drugs and smokes weed as if it isn't a big deal.  Me and other friends have tried to get him to stop but he just won't and we don't live close anymore (post-uni) so it's hard to have an impact.  I just hope he doesn't take a horrible turn.  \nAnyway, really glad to hear you got out of it okay and even became a better person for it.  I can't imagine how terrifying that must've been for you.

So now if you were to point it out to someone, what would you call it?\nWell, you'd call it a big, red square obviously. What else is there to call it?

Two friends actually.\nOne was at a festival (similar theme occurring here). He and a friend were going to sleep in a tent.  End of the night of course, MDMA taken over a long period.  My friend was trying to sleep but couldn't because he could hear his friend on the phone.  Eventually he got annoyed by it sat up and said \"Lee, can you get off the phone I'm trying to sleep\".  Lee sat up and said he was about to say the same to my friend...  both tripping balls about the same thing.\nThen, a group of my friends were all taking MDMA at uni in a house just chilling together.  It's the end of the night, a group of them were in a room together on the way down and one of them started falling asleep.  No conversation was flowing at the time, I think everyone was just relaxing doing whatever.  The friend trying to sleep sat up and replied to someone who said something to her.  Of course, no one said anything, she was just tripping out.  \nSo yeah, sounds like your experience.  Taking a lot can do that.  I usually get more visual shit than auditory after a heavy night.

He was feeling the inside of the tent with bolted eyes saying that \"they pissed on our tent I can feel and smell it\" and telling me to be quiet because they were on his facebook.  He also said that everyone's here to make his night bad and that they are on his grandparent's facebook.  Another night he did this one before the festival he got in this state and thought his mum had been stabbed and killed.  Plenty more delusional actions and words were coming out his mouth that night too.

The guy kept a couple chickens for eggs on the boat too. The monkey viewed the chickens as his pets and often held them, stroking them. One chicken stopped laying and the sailor decided to eat it. He took the chicken to his cutting board in the cockpit and cut its head off. The monkey watching this screamed in terror, then scrambled to the top of the sailboat mast. It stayed up there for 3 days until thirst drove it down. After that the monkey would run to the top of the mast if the man ever got his cooking knives out. "], "type": ["COMMENT"]}

Part of my job involves teaching inmates (in min - mod) to care for six retired racehorses and the farm itself. It's a pretty great program (we also have dog training, vegetable gardening, and even beekeeping programs across the state) and the men usually end up getting jobs working with horses after their release (they get a Groom 1 certificate). \nTwo people come to mind. \nOne guy got a job working for a well-known trainer in the area. The trainer has given jobs to a lot of people and is very well respected. Great guy. He let our graduate live in a trailer on his property (rent free), set him up with an old TV and PlayStation, had him eat dinner with the family, etc. The guy was a good guy but had a lot of family problems he just couldn't get away from. One night his sister called and said she was in trouble, and he panicked and took the trainer's truck without asking to help her. Not anything nefarious, but a breach of trust and he got fired. We saw him again helping him move his belongings out and try to find a job on the track. A lot of the guys we work with aren't necessarily terrible people, but have incredibly poor impulse control and it gets them into trouble. \nAnother guy is a better story. We had an open house at the barn for the public and one of our graduates came back for it. He was working in a factory at that point and had a steady place to live, had stayed clean, and so on. The horses LOVED him and clearly remembered him (as much as horses can). He was very open about his history with our visitors and most respected him. One thing that was depressing was that he had real trouble trying to get jobs with horses at some places (like vet clinics, rescues) where he would have had to administer drugs to the horses, because he had a drug conviction. This guy was like a goddamn horse magician and would have been great at those jobs. I understand the caution, but it just sucks seeing the trouble people have AFTER release getting housing, jobs, and fair treatment. We can teach them job skills and educate them and get them started but a lot of the time they just run into brick walls on the outside. "], "type": ["COMMENT"]}

I have a violent felony on my record, and that's the only legal trouble I've ever had besides a few traffic tickets.  I was a straight-A student, wasn't into drugs, never even been in a fist fight.  I have two college degrees, even won a number of legit writing competitions.  The felony resulted from an incident in 2009 when I'd suffered a severe mental health episode.  And when you hear the actual story of the incident, it's more pathetic than 'violent.'\nAnyways, thanks to the felony on my record, I've only been able to get one decent-ish job since, and even that has no benefits and I'm still technically below the poverty level.  I'm 34, but had to move back in with my parents because I can't afford my own place.  \nI hate that in a lot of ways I'm now lumped in the same group with career criminals, rapists, child molesters, gang-bangers, etc. and have to deal with the same prospects of basically no future, as far as secure employment with benefits/advancement goes, that I'll never have an actual career.  It's depressing when I stop to think that, since I can't ever get my record sealed or the conviction expunged, my life now, financially and socially, is basically about as good as it's ever going to get.\nSorry for the off-topic self-pity, but it's kind of overwhelming and disheartening sometimes.\nEdit: Thank you for the supportive comments, I genuinely appreciate them.  The state I live in/was convicted in allows for sealing/expunging some felony convictions after a certain amount of time, but since mine was 'violent,' there's no way to clear it from my record.  I know I was rather vague, but I don't really want to give specific details about my circumstances, since I'm a little paranoid about my privacy online.  I will say that it was a 2nd-degree assault charge with a weapon enhancement, though the extent of the 'damage' was the victim literally required two band-aids."], "type": ["COMMENT"]}

Over the next 3 years, that feeling was exacerbated by a string a bad relationships, and the realization that I just did not relate to any of the women I was dating. I was heartbroken, and lost all sense of self-worth. When you hit your late 20s, a lot of your single friends have the same fear that they let great relationships go, and they are stuck either being unhappy with someone, or being alone. Although I did not believe this story deep inside, I would always tell them about my father:\nMy mom passed away when I was 15, and my father was devistated. He refused to even consider dating for 5 years, and when he started, the relationships were disappointing. My dad has always been a negative person, so I just shrugged it off as par for the course. After a few long term relationships, all of which he would constantly complain about about, he was introduced to his current girlfriend, and things changed. My Dad would talk for hours to me about her, the things they did, and how happy her was, a side of him I never saw. Although he was great to my mother, and they were affectionate with each other, I was born 10 years after they met, and neither of them acted like this.\nA few years back, my father and his girlfriend flew across the country to visit me, both taking separate flights. Upon picking him up, we wait in the cellphone lot for an hour, catching up, and then he gets a call from his girlfriend to say her plane arrived. My father becomes somewhat manic, reminding me of her flight and looking at every sign to verify that we are at the terminal. Suddenly I hear this clapping sound, and look over to see my dad repeatedly hitting his palms on his legs, as they bounced up and down, like an child on christmas. As we approach the terminal, he sees his partner opens up the window and starts yelling her name, saying \"We're here, we're here!\". Before I can even come to a full stop, he opens the door, runs out and gives her this gigantic hug. My dad was 64 at the time, and acting like a teenage boy about to see his camp girlfriend for the first time in months.\nIt was then that I witnessed that even late-middle age people can fall head over heels in love again, and there trully is someone out there for us, even if we thought we lost the one. \nAlthough I would tell this story over and over again to cheer up friends, it wasn't until 1 year ago, when I started dating my current girlfriend, that I truly believed it. I am currently in the best relationship I have ever been in, and realized that we really aren't confined to that one. People change and no matter how rare it feels, you will meet someone again, and this time you will be more mature and ready to show them how you truly feel."], "type": ["COMMENT"]}

Prosecutors and law enforcement don't want anything to do with easing up sentences, lessening crimes, and the like, and they are a huge lobbying force.\nHere in California, we passed a ballot initiative last year (Prop 47) that reduced a lot of crimes that really shouldn't be felonies to misdemeanors: things like simple possession of most drugs, being under the influence of a drug (the equivalent of drunk and disorderly conduct, but because it's a drug, it used to be a felony), possessing a smoking device, writing a bad check for a fairly small amount of money, forgery with little to no damages, and such.  Some theft crimes went from straight felonies to \"wobblers\" (can be charged as either a felony or a misdemeanor).  Prosecution lost their fucking marbles over it.\nThere's a new program where people whose prison sentence was doubled due to their second \"strike\" felony can actually get out at the end of their regular sentence.  Essentially, if you stole a car, had a prior, and got a 16 month state prison sentence, you'd be spending 32 months in prison because of the strike; but if your instant offense was non-violent (like car theft, but not carjacking), you can actually get out after 16.  Naturally, prosecution is losing their marbles, and sending opposition letters to the paroling of any of these guys.\nThere's a new bill in the works doing away with a lot of asset forfeiture, so that prosecutors can't profit off of seizing money from drug dealers.  The California District Attorneys' Association is in and out of senate hearings, testifying against the bill.\nThere's a formidable, and very rigid force in prosecution/LE that does not want this to happen...  when it's really overdue."], "type": ["COMMENT"]}

She was paranoid from time to time about things. She would get depressed out of nowhere and swear she was hearing things. Then she would forget when I would tell her things and when I said I told her, she thought I was just trying to manipulate her.\nThis led to her deep depression, a falling apart of our relationship, then friendship, then we didn't talk at all.

But, I digress.\nMy aunt was watching me because my parents were out of town. She fed us lunch. \n peanut butter and jelly sandwiches. I refused to eat it. After 15 minutes she sat down and stared me down for another 15. She took me by the back of the neck, shoved the entire sandwich down my throat (remember, I was 3. This thing was bigger than my head), dragged me by the neck to the stairs, threw me down them, and locked me in her pitch black room for 3 days. I was fucking terrified. I peed myself and whenever I would try to get out by banging on the door, she would open it, knocking me over,and be right at the door, staring me down. I thought I was going to never see my parents again. \nFast forward to 3 days later, my parents returned. I tried to tell them what she did to me, but because I had such a terrible speech impediment (Speech therapy from ages 3-11) they couldn't understand me. It wasn't until I was 8 did they finally understand. However, they didn't believe me. "], "type": ["COMMENT"]}

My dad had been to jail before so he was good at handing out punishment. So when I was 12 and my brother was 10, we decided to go on a stealing spree. We stole toys from this comic book store, video games and toys from Walmart, and we got caught by the guy at the local video store trying to take some video games. He called our parents, they found out and realized where we had been getting all that shit. My Dad took us to every single store and made us return it to the manager and apologize. Well, last store is Walmart. We get there and the manager pulls my dad aside and says \"I have a friend who is a cop and he's in uniform in the back if you want to scare them\". Next thing I hear \"well boys, it's in the laws hands now, nothing I can do\". Naturally, I freak the fuck out. We're in this little break room with a cop slapping his hand cuffs on the table telling us he's going to have to take us to jail. We're both crying, my brother is saying I made him do it, you know how it goes. About 15 minutes later he finally says \"alright, tell you what, I'll let you go this time but if I ever see you again you're coming with me\". As if that wasn't bad enough, then the grounding part comes. It's middle of summer so my dad grounds us prison style for 4 weeks. Wake up at 6am, in bed at 8pm. He added up the value of everything we stole and we had to do manual labor, house work, yard work etc to pay it all off at $1.50 per hour. 3 meals a day only and fruit as a snack. Not allowed to leave the yard, no friends over, no video games, no tv. I never stole again. It was the longest 4 weeks of my life.\nFast forward 10 years later, I'm working in a pizza shop in town across from the police station. In walks a cop to order. I look at his name tag, Officer Wolf. I froze. I asked \"excuse me, do you remember 2 kids about 10 years ago who stole at Walmart and you took them in the back and scared them?\". His face lit up \"was that you?!\". \"Yes sir it was, and I never stole again. You scared me straight\". Nice guy. I definitely learned my lesson and I know what to do if my kids ever do the same shit."], "type": ["COMMENT"]}

There was this woman in her early 30's who would come in almost every evening. She would eat a giant plate of food, go to the bathroom, repeat. She would do this about 2-3 times every visit. Bulimia. She always came alone, sat alone at her booth, never really talked to anyone, but she was very nice, soft-spoken. I always wondered what happened to her after I quit. \nAbout a decade later, I started working at a large hospital in my hometown, and there is this woman in my department who looks \n familiar. She's quiet, polite, doesn't really socialize with anyone. One day, when I pulled up for work in the parking garage, I saw her sitting in her van next to my car. She didn't see me. She was power-eating a large container of some sort of food product. I got out of my car and went down to the department. She entered a couple minutes later, surprised I was so early, and went straight to the bathroom. After coming out, she told me she was going to go up to the cafeteria and grab some breakfast, as she was \n \nIt was the same woman. I realized where I recognized her from. Over a decade later, and she was still in the grips of her condition, it seemed. Working with her, I got to know her a little bit. She was single, never married. She had 3 cats. In the evenings after work she liked to put together puzzles at home. She would sometimes comment on her lack of a relationship, saying she just didn't really know how to meet anyone. I started to think, from the way she talked, that she might have never had a boyfriend. \nWhen one of her cats died, she took a week off work to mourn. They were her best friends. I always felt this overpowering sense of loneliness and shame about her. Having an eating disorder for so long, I have no doubt that that kind of lifestyle would isolate someone from those around them. Everyone in the department had caught on, but no one ever said anything. \nI always feel sad when I think of her. Always alone. I hope one day she gets help. "], "type": ["COMMENT"]}

It's sort of like how you tell yourself you don't want to eat something that you are craving. You sort of fight with yourself but imagine that happening all the time with everything.

It's like having bipolar and schizophrenia.  \nGenerally, I don't think anything is out of the ordinary when it's just hallucinations.  However that doesn't happen often because of the mood swings.  It's more schizo when there's no mood swings and more delusion when there is.\nI'd take the hallucinations any day of the week over the delusions.  Typically it is really positive.  It's like dreaming in High Def but you're awake.  I see things very clear but I wear glasses and my vision isn't that good so that can be a dead giveaway.  I see a lot of color, positive things like people are very attractive even though they may not be.  Hard to explain.  Also a lot of things play out as if they are happening and it's a trip.  Like, you see a cliff edge and all the sudden you're flying off of it and not falling.  A picture you're looking at appears to move and interact with you.  It's amazing but then you realize you're standing still and just staring.  To me, it's a lot like a dream.\nIf mood swings are involved, it sucks.  Paranoia is a bitch. I would not wish it on anyone.  I have more problems with the bipolar part really.  It's pretty rare to have hallucinations without mood changes but it happens.  Hence the schizoaffective.

She suddenly had a massive heart attack due to too much insulin.  Her cholesterol wasn't bad, she had just beaten cancer a year ago, and no one saw it coming.  She was 58.  I got the call from my father exactly one month ago today.  He told me how she died, and what he did to try and save her.  How she started snoring loudly in her sleep.  How he called 911 once she seemed Ill. How he sat on the phone with dispatch and kept trying CPR exactly as he was told and pumping her chest until the EMTs got into the room.\nI live alone 5000 miles away, I'm a 26 year old only child, and I couldn't afford to go home for any kind of service.  You always know inherently your parents will die, and think what you might say to family members or people at the funeral.  \nFor me there was no funeral, no family members, no anything.  No celebration of her life.  No closure.  We tried to work it out so I could visit, and my father just apologizes that she had no life insurance.  That they couldn't get a policy after she got cancer.  Then he tells me how she died, and what he did to try and save her.  How she started snoring loudly in her sleep.  How he called 911 once she seemed Ill. How he sat on the phone with dispatch and kept trying CPR exactly as he was told and pumping her chest until the EMTs got into the room.\nI feel so bad for him.  I've never seen such pure loneliness in my life.  He now is an amputee living alone, trying to figure out how to balance a checkbook.  Every time my father calls me now...the conversation starts normal.  Then he tells me how she died, and what he did to try and save her.  How she started snoring loudly in her sleep.  How he called 911 once she seemed ill. How he sat on the phone with dispatch and kept trying CPR exactly as he was told and pumping her chest until the EMTs got into the room.\nIf you thought it was hard to read three times, if you even bothered, I've heard it 20 times from the man himself.  Around time 5 or 6 I asked him to stop, a couple times I broke down crying, another time I called a local psychologist for him, but guess what no one is going to help him without being payed. I've tried telling its alright, you did your best, mom knows too, but he always says the story and it's getting hard to talk to him.\nIt feels like I lost both of my parents and I'm powerless to do anything about it and I'm just expected to get over it at work because it was 4 weeks ago already."], "type": ["COMMENT"]}

I'm studying other things and plan to go to grad school for those. However, I've made friends in theatre and I'm good at what I do. \nTheatre is hard. There's not a lot of support for it in general, it can be hard to find, as theatre people call it, \"your tribe\" (meaning people with the same artistic goals and visions as you). There's a lot of people who don't have a clue about how to run theatre as a business. It's a huge collaborative undertaking for every production, and people often don't know how to communicate with each other. \nThere's a lot of room for vanity. One-person, self-directed, self-written productions, for one. A lot of catty drama, gossip, negativity, big personalities, naivety and immaturity. And you do all this work to have it run for a month and then it gets torn down. \nMoney is a huge issue. The companies that get funding are ones that pander to their audiences (mainly wealthy older people, because those are the only people who can afford it) and therefore don't do new, innovative work which is a huge part of what theatre is about for me.\nBut I keep coming back. I've realized recently that I can be part of it without having it be my career. I need that creative outlet, but it still wares me down so much that it makes me dislike it. "], "type": ["COMMENT"]}

Your best possibilities are shrinking and falling away as you lower yourself to busting ass just to maintain. All the good ideas you might have are going to be replaced by angry internal ranting. The moments that you want to happen are going to happen when you've gotten enough rest and are relaxed enough to notice them. Your entire world gets defined by the need to maintain, but for what? To do it again tomorrow?\nIf you can scale back what you're maintaining and give yourself more time to live life, even if you spend it looking at the ceiling, it will be worth it. Plus, everybody tells themselves they're going to do something amazing someday... for decades on end.

He doesn't believe in ghosts at all but he did tell of two incidences that happened in two different abandoned places. The first was at Penn State. The group split up and of course it was dark. My son is not afraid of most things, just homeless people they encounter from time to time. He said he was looking around and it was very quiet. All of a sudden he heard a loud sound which startled him but it didn't scare him. He figured it was an animal and he didn't hear anything more from that place. The next thing that happened was in some abandoned hotel, several stories tall. Again the group split up and this was during the day. When my son starts setting up his camera and tripod he sees out of the corner of his eye, a person walking down the stairs on the opposite side of the room. Still messing with his camera he yells out, \"Hey, who's that?\" No answer. He turns to look and there wasn't anyone there. He grabs his camera, goes up the stairs and finds the rest of the group and asked them who came down in the basement where he was. No one did. They never figured out who the figure was.

Coincidentally (or not) Mexico has strong laws against foreign military involvement that prevent this.  \nedit: yeah... just for anybody bothering to reply to my comment. I was assuming \n was asking why the USA couldn't bilaterally intervene. I thought I did not have to explicitly state that the USA \n by declaring war on Mexico because that would be \n.  \nedit 2:\nSo, the USA could hypothetically intervene militarily in Mexico's cartel related troubles in two ways: unilaterally (without the Mexican government's support) or bilaterally (with Mexico's support). Any action that was unilaterally of any significant scale would be disastrous for USA - Mexico relations, unilateral action against a friendly nation would also be disastrous for foreign relations for the USA in general. It would not be like military action in Iraq or Syria because Mexico is a friendly country that shares a border the USA and also has deep cultural, financial ties with the USA. This scenario is simply not worth discussing because of it's ludicrous nature. On the other hand bilateral intervention is certainly worth discussing. It would not hurt USA - Mexico relations (at least at a government level). However there is one very particular reason that prevents USA from this type of action. Mexico has laws in it's constitution that prevent the Mexican government from allowing foreign militaries access to Mexican territory. Even if the Mexican government wanted help from USA to fight the cartels any action would be unconstitutional. These are not laws that can be changed easily. So bilateral action is not possible for the immediate future.  \nThankyou for your patience."], "type": ["COMMENT"]}

Both of these things will contribute to the mattress not sagging over time.\nMaybe you're about to say \"but I can't sleep on a firm mattress\"... That's fine, it doesn't have to stay firm. Let me explain...\nWith a soft mattress, or especially a pillow-top mattress, that soft top covering will eventually form a divot where you sleep. It \n compress over time. That's just a fact.\nHowever, if you get a very firm mattress, you can put a memory foam pad (or regular pad) on top (of whatever thickness you want). If that soft top layer has a problem after a couple years, you can replace it. But if it's built into the \"soft mattress\", you're fucked.\nThis is all soft mattress are btw... they're just the firm models with extra padding built in on top.\nGo to a mattress store, and look at one brand's line of mattress. I promise that it will start (on the low end) with a firm mattress and they get more expensive as you add more padding.\nOn a side note, this is also the reason that mattress salesmen don't want to sell you a firm mattress: They're less expensive with less markup. I've literally had salesmen turn around and walk away from me when I said I want a firm mattress. It was crazy.\n To all the people saying that I'm lying about the salesman walking away... I don't know what to say, my claim is impossible to prove, especially over the internet. But I swear it actually happened."], "type": ["COMMENT"]}

The \"ghostly\" sounds can be explained in any number of ways, from him planting a radio (or a friend) further down the shaft to simply inserting it digitally after recording.\nI don't generally believe in any of that stuff and don't go around looking for evidence or opportunities to discredit it, but those videos gave me the biggest bullshit vibe ever."], "type": ["COMMENT"]}

You know, just... add them up. What you really should be googling is \"BMR calculator.\" Put in your stats and it tells you the amount of calories you burn in a 24 hour period of lying in bed and doing nothing. Take that number, and depending on how fast you want to lose weight subtract a little or a lot from it. That number is your caloric goal for the day. As a general rule of thumb, the slower you lose the weight the better. Counting itself is obviously basic maths, but you should plan your meals if possible. Have one cheat day per week, but don't be an idiot even on that cheat day. Get one regular coke, then it's back to diet. Oh and, no drinking calories in general, unless it's your post-workout protein shake that is part of your meal plan.\nFor reference, my BMR is ~1850 and I aim at 1600 calories a day. 30 minutes of cardio burning ~400 calories 5 times a week. I've lost 16 kilos (~35 lbs?) in 5 months this way. That might not sound like a lot, but that's because I'm already bordering non-overweight territory, and I still have pizza and burgers and beer now and then. I don't starve myself, and the diet hasn't been hard to keep up AT ALL. Remember, slow and steady wins the race in weight loss. Hope that helps a bit, good luck!"], "type": ["COMMENT"]}

Want to write a book? Fuck publishers, sign up with Amazon. Want to make a video? Put it on YouTube and set up monetization. Are you a musician? Go straight to iTunes or a comparable service.\nAnd these are just the established services. If you can make something better, the Internet will use it. There's new and innovative ideas all the time.\nLook at stuff like Teespring where anyone can design a t-shirt and collect pre-orders. Reach a certain goal and the run of shirts gets produced. No worries about stock, no worries about shipping or logistics.\nIf you went back even 20 or 30 years and said \"People will make a living talking about _____\" you can fill in the blank with most topics (except the most important stuff like politics and news) and no one would believe you. But there are hundreds of podcasts that talk about everything ranging from politics to DIY to gaming to crazy niche stuff like alcohol-fueled history or a bunch of guys taking the piss out of a crappy C-Movie.\nNever, ever, \n let the big corps control the Internet. They are going to really, really try. They are going to trot out the classic \"protect the kids\" card. They are going to whine about intellectual property losses and how they need to protect things (nevermind that generally entertaniment industries are making more money now than they ever have, looks like Kazaa didn't kill music after all). They are going to lie, cheat, bribe, and steal in order to try to retain the power that they hold only because they have money.\nBut as things stand, the only real value they can bring to the individual artist is advertising and networking with skilled people - and advertising is really the only thing out of reach of the independent person (at least on the scale a big corporation can do it). But in the long run, advertising doesn't count for all \n much. Every huge YouTuber started with 0 subscribers, and some of them make millions now without having signed their soul away to some terrible contract. (Well, except for those few poor souls who signed up with Machinima back in its most exploitative days).\nThe true power of the Internet is that it's relatively easy for anyone to use. The barrier of entry is so low that it's subterranean. If there is any one thing that will be the important thing our generation must fight for, it's this."], "type": ["COMMENT"]}

Every time I've gone to see her she has been sitting outside of the front doors in her walker. I always ask her how long she has been outside and she tells me that she has been there for less than 5 minutes or so. The last time I went to see her she was sitting outside again and I decided for some reason to see how long she would stay outside as I had heard that she was becoming very disassociated from everyone and everything at her hospice. I sat on some steps about a half a block away and watched her sit there for over 45 minutes not making a single move. She was just staring forward as if she were paralyzed. I sat there and cried, devastated that this is how my mothers life is going to end. When I finally approached her I asked her how long she had been outside for. She said about 5 minutes. I broke down again, hugged her, and took her back inside. She barely remembers me and all she wants to talk about in her lucid moments is how much she misses my step-dad who died 15 years ago. It just absolutely breaks my heart that she lived with that for 15 years and that its all she can think about when she is aware. \nI'm not sure if this will be buried or not and I'm sure you've all heard it before, but please, please do not take the people in your life for granted. All it takes sometimes is for you just to be there. Just to let someone know that they aren't alone. \nEDIT: First off I would like to say thank you to everyone who commented with well wishes. Sometimes internet hugs and condolences mean a lot more than you think. \nTo everyone who is going through something similar, I am terribly, terribly sorry, and if you think it would help you as much as all of these comments has helped me please feel free to me shoot me a message. \nAnd the obligatory thanks for the reddit gold stranger!"], "type": ["COMMENT"]}

Just like you or me would if we had to survive in that environment.\nEvery time I've met an inmate outside, they are either very polite or ignore me completely. They don't want to acknowledge that part of their past for the most part.\nBest meeting was at the liquor store, I was buying beer and he said hello. Then I reminded him he had a no-liquor or drug clause on his parole, he said it was for his wife. I said \"I'll act like I believe you\", laughed and walked out. He came back in a few weeks later, for drinking. When he saw me he thanked me for trying to remind him, and for not ratting him out. I just didn't want to do the paperwork.\nThe \"worst\" encounter was actually two part. He a young wannabe gang-banger who always acted up in front of his friends. When he saw me, he immediately fell into his \"routine\", slouching, \"maaaaan\" slang talk, and swinging his arms all around as if he was king shit. I just stopped and stared at him and let him talk. Eventually he said something stupid like \"Ey' boss, you scared? Aint none of your co-workers here to help you out eh!\" without blinking I replied \"and there aren't any of your friends here either...\" leaving the words hang there. He didn't really know what to say, probably felt stupid, and just kind of left.\nI saw him a few weeks later, and he just nodded and walked by.\nWhen he came back in, I had nothing but respect from him.\nOften times, as those who work inside know, it's not what you say, but what is left unsaid or how it is said that can make all the difference. The reason the last one was so effective was for a few reason;\nOverall, they won't acknowledge you, but if they do, it's 99% positive. They are just human after all.\nOn another awkward note, I have had inmates at work ask me if I enjoyed my night out on Friday at \"**\" club. That's a bit unsettling, but they just try to get under your skin. You just don't know if it's coworkers talking too much, or if he had a friend watching.

I hope. Maybe. But I'm still lonely and friendless, but now I have genuinely interesting academics to distract me - sure, no one talks to me, but people will respect me and ask for help on AP homework pretty often, so the social situation is slightly better, and just being able to tune out and work on something that absorbs you is pretty nice. If you can, try and take some art or engineering or shop classes - anything that involves you \n something tangible can help a lot with the weird depersonalization issues that can result from this - e.g., you never talk, so your voice is quiet, so no one hears you, so you can feel like you've been screaming the same thing for five minutes but no one's noticed you. You can't ignore art or a piece of furniture.  \nAnyway, here's some more lovely incidents."], "type": ["COMMENT"]}

It was 30 guys and 2 girls - me, and the girl who sat next to me. Our professor was an older Asian dude with the absolute worst accent I have ever had in a teacher. The entire class could barely understand him.\nUsually, class would just be an hour of lesson, then 2 hours of working on homework or projects (3 hour class 2 times a week). The girl who sat next to me went to a tutor, and we shared notes and things and kept up low-B averages in the class, which put us in the higher grade range of the class average. \nSo one day, there's a problem we're stuck on. Her tutor's notes aren't helping much, so we ask our professor for help. He is a MASSIVE asshole, and starts freaking out when he learns she goes to a tutor. He's talking loudly so the class can hear and says \"women always do poorly in my class. You should pick a more appropriate major for yourselves, like something in elementary education.\" \nThe other girl was super offended. She reported him to the department head, and a few days later he made the announcement that he was tenured, and can say whatever he likes to us without fear of being fired.\nFuck that guy.

I was the only person the teachers allowed to do group assignments alone in high school, because by then I was so deeply friendless that I think they pitied me. I never had anyone to pair up with.\nInstead of trying to hang out with other kids as a child I used to go on second life, which is a \"virtual world\" where everyone has an avatar and you can talk through your avatar with your mic. Only no one would talk to me so I would bump into their avatars and purposely do or say dumb stuff. Nothing aggressive or mean, just dumb. Which made them angry and they'd start yelling at me and telling me what a loser I was. It made me feel bad but it also made me feel energized because I was actually interacting with other human beings. Being normal trying to start conversations made me invisible so I was always doing dumb shit online.\nThe few times I managed to make acquaintances with someone my mom would yell at me and make fun of them after they left for reasons like their laugh is too loud, their parents are crazy. She didn't want children to come over. In middle school she used to come at me all disgusted and accuse me of being friends with kids because I wanted to have sex with their parents. She would also stalk them so I felt bad having people over, it felt like I was allowing their privacy to be violated. By late middle school I was too socially stunted to make acquaintances at all.\nHow is your life now? I'd be interested in more examples of your life."], "type": ["COMMENT"]}

It's not just like \"hey those guys are in trouble lets give them money.\" Its more like \"hey if these guys go under the whole US economy will be in even more trouble\" \n AIG is a company that insured tons of other companies. Even though they had shady practices, if we didn't bail them out that would have affected a TON of other companies that relies on their insurance. So yes we gave money to those who may have caused the recession, but we also saved the US economy (which largely affects other countries economy) from an even bigger recession. Also we didn't just give them money for nothing, we bough financial instruments from them, so we actually are making a return on the investment and will end up far ahead. It's as if we bought their stock at a super low price and now that they're doing well we get have all those assets which is much more than we invested. Once again not an expert, so if there are inaccuracies someone should correct me!\nEdit: replaced Bear Stearns with AIG"], "type": ["COMMENT"]}

She can't go out much anymore so I don't either because it makes her incredibly depressed that shes missing out on life. We went from having amazing and frequent sex to very infrequent and it's not good. She never smiles, laughs or really has any fun anymore but I understand why. She went from being an affectionate person to cold, if she hugs or touches me on her own anymore its a rare thing. She had goals and passions in life, those are all gone now. She gets upset and angry over every little thing, but worse she harbors her anger over all these minor things.\nBut I love her, or maybe the memory of who she used to be? I know if I leave her that her life is pretty much over. She wouldn't be able to afford a place to live, the cost of her medications which make life 'tolerable', and she really has no one else to fall back on. I'm 100% confident she would commit suicide inside of a few months.\nI miss having fun, going out, experiencing new things, laughing with someone I love, caressing them, sharing in their passions in life, ..feeling loved. I'm so lonely for real female companionship."], "type": ["COMMENT"]}

I don't recall now if it was the Red Cross or some children's charity but anyway, I digress, I came to an old rundown terraced house towards the end of my circuit and decided I'd knock on the door. \nNow, it was raining heavily and bitterly cold outside so ice was forming on the pavements and road. I waited for what felt like an eternity before the door finally opened. What I saw surprised me: a multiple amputee was crawling on the floor, apologising profusely for taking so long to answer the door. \nI told him a little about the charity and he invited me in so he could fetch his wallet to make a donation; at the time we weren't allowed to accept cash donations but the old fella insisted and handed me a 10 pound note. I tried to give him the money back but he told me to hang on to the cash to pass on to my manager etc. The guy's house was a real mess, and the only company he seemed to have were a couple of cats which were all too happy to climb up my suit and perch on my shoulders. \nI sat and spoke with the old man for a while and he explained that he had been in a terrible accident which had led to both of his legs being amputated, and resulted in the limited use of one of his arms. I couldn't help but feel he needed the charity more than the folks I was working for and I asked him if I could do anything for him before I left. \nHe asked me to go to the shop for him and buy a few groceries, now I kindly obliged. When I returned to his house after trudging through the horrid weather, he asked me to stay and have a drink with him. I soon learned that nobody had been to visit him in a long time and he was absolutely ecstatic to have another soul to speak to. \nI must admit when I finally said goodbye and left him alone in his run down old house, I felt utterly saddened by his circumstances but absolutely awestruck that someone in such a position was so willing to give what little money they had freely to help others. \nSorry for the long story.

Once I got a car and insurance (both of which I had to pay for with money I saved from household chores), I thought I would finally be able to hang out with people and be popular. Up until late junior year, that was personified by me trying waaaaay too hard to make friends and coming off as socially awkward/creepy. At the end of my junior year, I had exactly one friend.\nThis friend of mine was also into similar music and also played guitar, so we made a band together senior year. He had other friends capable of playing music so it seemed like a good thing we had going. To top it off, I got my first girlfriend senior year. Things were looking pretty great and I was bright-eyed and optimistic about everything for a short while.\nThen, around February of my senior year everything started going downhill. My girlfriend at the time's friends hated me for taking her time/attention away from them. Side note/life lesson: if someone is making you choose between having them and another person in your life, always choose the person who isn't making you choose. Long story short, she didn't follow that advice. She was slowly distancing herself from me and being the naiive high schooler I was, I thought I'd done something wrong and tried to make up for it. I tried to win her back with a bunch of what I considered \"grand romantic gestures\" - wrote/played her songs, bought her presents, etc. A It culminated one day when I filled her locker with a few hundred origami Pikachus (she liked Pikachu). She broke up with me on the spot, in front of a lot of people. Pretty embarrassing.\nMeanwhile, tension within my high school band was also rising. I was doing most of the work - I'd designed some merch, gotten in contact with promoters, and tried to record music. Unfortunately, the rest of the band members were pretty bad at being musicians - they never wanted to record demos and when they did, they couldn't even keep tempo. All of the music on our demo was recorded by me. Then, once the drama with my girlfriend started, local promoters started noticing us and the rest of the band started wanting to play gigs. I was too busy trying to \"win back\" my girlfriend, and long story (slightly) shorter my band broke up the same week I got dumped.\nThat put me in a really bad place for a while and killed most of my creativity/made me a lot more cynical.

The first day of class he emailed me about 2 hours beforehand saying he couldn't make it so I would have to cover, then he emailed me some scans of his crappy notes.  After going over it for about an hour I decided to just do the best I could, and to cover the course basics (timeline, description, etc).  \nHe was such a jerk he lectured me about how important first classes are when he got back, becuase I didn't go through some rudimentary definitions about Geo is.... unreal.  So then he got ANOTHER TA to help out (this class was enormous), and he would only acknowledge that guy and just cc me on all the emails.  I had no idea what this guy's problem was.\nThe rest of that semester he would constantly criticize my presentations to the class.  It was an entry level class so on this \"major\" class assignment, about 1/5th of the class didn't hand it in on time.  He then accused me of losing papers for the class.  So I sent out a mass email to ALL of the students papers I was missing, warning them about their late submissions... which they all acknowledged, thereby proving to him how disinterested these students were in his class.\nHe then proceeded to get to me single handedly grade 250+ essays in 3 days time because he was \"too busy\".... this was about a week before my deadline to submit my thesis proposal.  When I did grade them, the few times a student ever brought up an issue (4 in total, with maybe 1 legit), he ALWAYS sided with the students and threw me under the bus.\nThe next semester he was in charge of delegating TAs to different classes.  He proceeded to put me in a field methods class from which I had NO previous experience with.  As if, just to spite me.  I did end up enjoying that class a great deal, and the prof of that class was great..... but WOW, what an asshole.\nEDIT\nI should also mention that I took an extra year to complete my thesis for personal reasons.  The entire faculty knew of my defense date and almost all of them showed up in my support.  Guess who was the only one missing?  I made him look like an asshole by \"thanking\" him for his lessons at the end of my defense, and expressing \"confusion\" as to how he wasn't there.  The rest of the faculty shook their heads at him, so at least I got some satisfaction over exposing how much of a jerk he was."], "type": ["COMMENT"]}

He went from head of the teachers union to asked not to return to the classroom. It was a slow progression, but got pretty weird. A girl who sat in the center front of the room once brought an apple as a snack. She finished it and left the core on the corner of the table to throw out after class. The prof said \"Are you going to finish that?\" And proceeded to eat the rest of the core. He also was notorious for drinking out of water bottles of whomever sat in the front row. \nAnother day he decided we were going to talk about charismatic leaders (no where near what was on the syllabus) and pulled something out of his bag and tossed it to me. Giant Nazi flag.  Yet another day he decided to talk about social norms (again, not even close to the syllabus) and asked someone to read aloud from the text while he climbed onto the table in the front of them room and pulled down the projector screen just enough to look through the handle like a periscope. When he was done with that, he began to dance and take his shirt off. \nHe was involved in some sort of police matter outside of class, a bar fight if I remember correctly, and was often receiving calls during class, sometimes from lawyers, some from media. He'd take every call and say \"Hello ______\n____\" and hold out his phone so we could all say hello. \nWe ended up with a new prof for the last 3 weeks of class and zero grades from the rest of the semester. It was something else. "], "type": ["COMMENT"]}

One day while fishing in some lazy back water off the Arkansas we (my GF and I) heard a faint, very faint raised voice. We stopped and listened intently. The wind and noises of the water lapping against the side of the boat made it impossible to make out what they were saying but it sounded serious. So we stowed the fishing gear and made towards the sound. When we came out of the backwater area towards the main channel we could see a capsized boat with two people clinging to it desperately screaming for help. A pretty dangerous situation, they appeared to have no life vests on and the river was carrying them away. We made our way over and helped the couple into our boat and made for shore so I could go back and retrieve the boat. Another boater saw what was happening and made his way to the capsized boat. The couple were older and clearly exhausted from their ordeal. From talking with them they told me they had hit a sandbar going top speed (was only a 25 HP motor and a 16 ft boat) and when the boat suddenly stopped water swamped over the stern and turned the boat over. After dropping the couple off on the bank with my GF to rest I helped the other boat tow the boat to the bank. When we got it there we managed to get enough of the boat on the bank so we could turn it over and begin dewatering it. Once it was seaworthy again I towed it back to the boat ramp for them and they were able to get it back on a trailer and they left after thanking us profusely. \nTLDR helped an old couple after their boat capsized.

Well one year the outdoor Freezer get's left open on the farm over night. Everything thaws and spoils in the morning heat. My step mom blames me, and I say it couldn't be me.\nYou see, my dad lived in the middle of nowhere Louisiana, and the dumpster was only cleared about once every few days by another town. So in order to make sure it wasn't riddled with trash pandas or bears, whenever someone had organs or carcasses of fish or chickens or whatever you'd put them in a  Freezer bag, and Fill it with water and freeze it before taking it to the dumpster. \nThe last time I went to the freezer was before dinner to drop the fish heads in the freeze. My step mom went after dinner because she wanted a fruit pop. \nI point all this out but my step mom is enraged that a child would suggest she is lying. I say to her that I'm not saying she's lying but doesn't remember it correctly or has maybe forgotten. She tells my father he needs to fix me since my mother raised someone so disrespectful. My dad relents and ends up blaming me for the freezer, and I was punished in the following way.  \nI was told I had to write a 5 page apology for lying about my step mom doing it, 5 pages on why I was disrespectful and why my mom raised me incorrectly and then sign it promising I would respect my elders better. \nSecond, I had to work off my new \"debt\" to my father. After adding up everything in the freezer they told me I owed them $1200. My step mom drafted a list of chores and how much they were worth towards my debt. \nThe point being each of these tasks took several hours to complete and were only worth a few dollars a piece. \nIt took me years, and I mean literally 5 years of backbreaking labor to pay off my \"debt\" slowly clearing land and cleaning it up of fallen trees, dislodged branches, and stumps. The land slowly shaped into beautiful pasture and eventually my father got cows. \nIt was unforgivable what my father did in this regard and but I did start to appreciate the land I toiled and bled over, I started to look forward to it as my inheritance. \nMy dad sold it two months ago. Didn't even tell me, butchered the cows and bought a Mercedes. I found out after someone else mentioned it in passing. \nNever even got to say goodbye to the land. \nThis all happens when I was 10 or so, I'm 25 now. "], "type": ["COMMENT"]}

About 2000, my kids were small. It's teeming with fish in that area and I headed for a trough that NASA cut out to build the fuel railroad system out to the launch area. It holds black drum as well as other tasties. \nI have a trolling motor on the side of the canoe and I head for my spot down the south shore. Over to my left, just as I arrive at the south end of the trough, I see a pod of manatee in the water about 75 yards away. I have a little camera stowed away and I decide to get some up close pics for the kids. \nI turn west into the middle of the lagoon area and head over shallow water and grass beds with my trolling motor turned to 5, top speed. I notice it appears VERY shallow immediately ahead of me and I cut the motor quickly to 0. \nThat's the last thing I remember before the loudest noise, that came from all around me. Water exploded. Around and under my 75lb canoe with 150lb me in the back. \nThe front of my canoe went up at over a 45% angle and the rear of my canoe, with me in it, came off the surface of the water some amount such that my battery came off the floor. In the front of my canoe, all my tackle and such was launched into the air. I remember seeing a single large pinfish (not mine but one belonging in the water) arcing over the whole mess as I gripped the gunnels.\nIt's not obvious what happened to me for a minute. I was so afraid and so vulnerable and unsure if it would happen again. \nI reattached things back at my trolling motor (wires had come loose, I think) and went to the shoreline (where the railroad passed) and got out and tried to piece my equipment back together and my experience. \nThe pod of roughly 21 manatees (number from ranger) had come into the lagoon area recently and as it turns out, they have a similar danger signal to beavers--they slap the surface of the water. When that many do it, and it's in 2 feet of water, and they are really frightened by my entry into the area, it can almost violate the laws of bowel physics. \nTrust me I know.

It was a pretty chill time and 12 year old me loved sitting on it and looking out at the sea.\nThen we hear the crew yell something; they'd spotted dolphins! Cool! So we get up, can see them jumping a bit off the distance in parallel to how we're travelling.  Then we notice they're getting closer.  And closer. \nI go back to the netting, thinking I'll be able to see one as it passes beneath the boat.  I look down at just the wrong moment as this complete derp of a dolphin decide that was the perfect time to jump - when he was UNDERNEATH the boat - and headbutts me.\nHe lands back in the water and the school moves on, but my day is ruined by a bloody nose and black eye from getting a Glasgow Kiss by fucking Flipper.\nEdit: and now this is my top rated comment.

That's the thinking of a poor person, peasant. Time is money, and a Roomba is a great return on investment. Let me adjust your mentality for you:\nHow much do you make per hour working? Let's say you make about $14 per hour (about $29k per year full time). Remember opportunity costs? What are you giving up in order to do something else? Sure, you don't do chores during your working hours, so I usually calculate my \"non-working awake hours\" at half the rate of my working hours -- because I could \n be doing something productive or valuable. Chores could be even costing me possible time for pleasure or enjoyment -- which has a value to it. Even sleep has value to it (which I assign at 1/4th the pay rate of my working hours).\nSo let's say it takes you 30 minutes to vacuum manually, instead of enjoying a half hour of Netflix, half an hour of building that startup website, or half an hour  with your significant other. So at a halved rate of $7/hour, that's $3.50 of your time you saved from not having to vacuum. I recommend you get a new Roomba from Bed Bath and Beyond for $399, then stack their frequent 20% off coupon on top of it, to knock of a delicious $80. The cost of a manual vacuum cleaner costs about $100, so if you vacuum once a week, you'll make back your investment in just a bit over a year. $3.50 x 52 weeks = $182.\nAdditionally, besides saving a bunch of time, it'll also keep your place free of dust, pollen, and other allergens more regularly than your possibly lazy ass. It will also improve the smell of your place if you have lots of carpeting.\nLife is short. You have only about 30,000 days in a lifespan. Don't waste your precious time on things that can be replaced with devices or automation that are still affordable.\nTL;DR - assign value to your time; buy a Roomba for ROI\nSource: I have significantly above average income\nEdit: typo\nEdit 2: nice, thanks for gold, redditor\nEdit 3: math pointed out by redditor"], "type": ["COMMENT"]}

One day, I opened up Windows Media Player's Media Guide and, as a joke, typed in \"sonic the hedgehog\", thinking I wasn't going to find anything. What I did find however, was \n. After searching through the site it was from - OverClocked ReMix - and becoming a member, I was a regular poster of the \"post funny pictures\" thread (this was the days before stuff like \n and the like) and, after finding another site with a bunch of material to cross-post, I joined \n site's forum (and I still regularly visit that place too, although the forum itself has dropped in activity over the past couple years, sadly.. it's been 10 years since I opened my account there too).\nSo, after happily chatting with the people on the forum, I noticed that one of the members had started a personal music project. Now, I was always that \"I can do that too!\"-kind of kid back then, and since I was a short-time poster on OverClocked ReMix's forums and had attempted to do one or two \"ReMixes\" of my own (which completely sucked and I like to think that no-one online has them anymore - I only have a copy of it on my harddrive because I never delete stuff), I figured I'd give it a shot. I picked up my acoustic guitar (incorrectly strung because I play left-handed), made a handful of songs (half of which were half-assed covers) on a crappy headset microphone, and left it at that. I did end up making stuff that was a little more electronic, since I had a sequencer but again, outside of the video I would put on YouTube, nothing came from it.\nThen in the beginning of 2009 (so this is about 3-4 years later), I was let go from the job I was working in. Kind of a bummer. So while searching for a new job I remembered that, back when I was studying at college for a computing course, my friend at the time was studying at a nearby college doing a course in music (but had dropped out in the second half). I figured, \"Since I like making music (thanks to the guys on the forum giving me the idea to do so), I'll give it a shot\". One of the modules was to compose a piece of music set to a piece of video, as if we were writing a new soundtrack to it. Well, I fell in love with the idea immediately. After I completed my two years of college, I found out the University in the same city was doing a similar course.\nFast forward three years: I graduated University, I'm a qualified sound engineer, I produced my debut album and have been putting together ideas for the next one, and on top of that, I'm currently in the middle of setting up my own business where I plan on composing music for other clients.\nAll because the 16-year-old me searched \"sonic the hedgehog\" on some arbitrary search engine.\n Sonic the Hedgehog made me graduate University.\n((and because people last time were asking about it, here's a link to said album: \n))"], "type": ["COMMENT"]}

However, unlike their success in America, they never really had a strong case in the UK. There seems to be an acceptance within British culture that everyone is going to be drinking, so solutions to excess drinking aren't to ban drinking entirely (as preferred in the US and by prohibitionists) but instead, authorities chose to take more practical, incremental approaches to dealing with what was, by all accounts, a horrific epidemic of alcoholism in the UK (and the US, for that matter).\nHealth advocates - The advent of gin, which was excessivly drank by many working class people, led to a health-based argument against strong alcohol. Like in America, there is strong overlap between the purely health advocates who were concerned about what was clearly a public epidemic of alcoholism, and the prohibitionists who relied on a more moralistic / family-based argument. The difference is subtle, but worth remembering. Everybody knew that the working class was drinking heavily - in fact, some people argued it was their medicine to cope with their Dickensian environments - but the advent of gin, along with the addition of adulterants by less reputable manufacturers, took that drinking habit to a new level. Alcoholism skyrocketed and social unrest was blamed, in part, on workers who had turned to drink to cope with the destruction of their social ties as they left farms to work in factories. And all this happened at the same time that gin, which is something like ten times more potent than an average beer by ABV, came along. Anyway, people in this broad category of health advocates argued for the creation of lower-alcohol alternatives to nip alcoholism in the bud. They also, incidentally, began the glorification of the idea of the \"local\" or \"neighborhood pub\" that is still used in marketing materials today. The logic there is that, if the working man drinks beer or cider in a social environment (instead of gin in a gin house, or in an alley), he'll get less drunk and be a better father, worker etc. By forcing workers to drink less potent alcohol, in social situations, it was hoped that the alcohol epidemic could be curbed.\nWars: During WWI, the UK set a cap on the maximum alcohol percentage that beer could be. Having a plastered or horribly hungover workforce making your munitions is generally considered poor form by military experts, so they mandated a cap on ABV to keep their workers sober. That cap continued for a while, and is why Guiness is the alcohol content that it is today.\nAs my final note of interest, the reason that \"stout\" and \"porter\" exist as classifications of beer come to us from before WWI. High-ABV beers of any style were \"stouts\" (so you could have a \"stout pilsner\" or a \"stout IPA\"), with our traditional dark-beer, malty guiness-style beers being \"porters.\" Guiness was a high ABV porter, so it called itself \"extra porter\" or \"stout porter\" until it settled on its final, familiar naming. Anyway during WWI the caps hit Guinness, so they lowered their % to what it is now. That renders the \"stout\" part of Guinness \"extra stout\" rather meaningless, helping to muddle the \"stout\" and \"porter\" distinction which preceded it. Today there is really no difference between \"stout\" and \"porter\" beyond conventional norms that have arisen in the 20th century about what those terms mean."], "type": ["COMMENT"]}

It was on a Saturday at 8am and the teacher would have us read a book a week. The books were actually pretty good, but during class she would just talk for three hours about how important the religious values were that the book was teaching. She took every single kids book and basically made it a sermon even though her points were bat shit crazy. Whenever someone expressed a different opinion than her, she would ask them their name and then tell them to get out of her class room. On the subsequent assignment, because it was fairly opinion based, they could count on a failing grade even if it was perfectly written and they were right in their assessment.

Nor do I know anyone who owns a gun. This was also largely the case in the other major city I previously lived in (again in the north). The only person I knew there who owned a gun was a friend who worked in law enforcement.\nAre there people who own guns (both legal and illegal) in both of these cities? Certainly. But they are a relatively small minority and I personally never meet them, which I think might have something to do with my age (I'm mid-twenties) in addition to the fact that there aren't many of them. It seems like most gun owners in both areas are on the older side.\nOf course, once you go out into rural areas, there is a lot more gun ownership. But there is more in the current state I live in than the state I left as even though both cities are very similar politically, the rural areas of this state are more conservative.\nAll this is to say that the US is a big country with a lot of diversity. Some cities and states have a lot of gun ownership, others have very little. It really depends where you go.\nEdit: Coming back to this thread, I don't think it's doing a great job of giving a representative sample of actual U.S. gun ownership. Only 32% of Americans own a gun or live with someone who does.\nBased on this thread, you'd think that 90% of Americans own a gun and 90% of those own multiple guns. It's not particularly surprising that the gun owner posts get more upvotes, they're more interesting to read than someone saying \"no I don't own a gun.\"\nBut it does mean you should take this thread with a big grain of salt as it's not giving all that accurate of a representation of gun ownership rates."], "type": ["COMMENT"]}

If that sounds like you, then make sure to research the average income boost, \n.  Not all college degrees provide an equal income boost.  If college is a financial investment to you, then you want to maximize your return on that investment.  This is the easiest comparison to do, because it's just dollars to dollars.  If you find a major that interests you, and that provides an income boost that meets your expectations for an investment, then you should go to college.\nSome people want to go to college because they don't want to do physical labor their whole lives.  If that sounds like you, it probably means that the specific kind of work you do is important to you.  If that's the case, you should spend time investigating different kinds of work \n you consider college.  Figure out where you want to end up, then plan your path to get there.  Maybe that path leads through college, maybe it doesn't.  Maybe it's the kind of thing where you can get into the industry right away, and you wouldn't need a degree until several years into your career, so you might be able to get your employer to partially subsidize your education while you work.  The important thing, if you're this kind of person, is that you don't want to end up with an expensive degree that only qualifies you for work you don't want.  You can already get work you don't want without a degree or the associated debt.  Also important, if you're this kind of person, is that you understand that college might not provide a significant financial benefit to you.  If the happiness you would get from doing a particular kind of work is worth the cost of the education you need to get there, then go for it.  If not, then look elsewhere.\nSome people go to college for the life experience.  They find that the value of spending four years on campus, whatever they studied, to be worth the cost of college.  If that sounds like you, then you should compare the cost of college to the cost of other experiences that get you what you are looking for.  Would backpacking around Europe get you the experiences that you are looking for?  Maybe joining the military would do it?  It really depends on what you want to get out of the experience.  If what you really want is to spend your fall afternoons discussing philosophy in the quad, then you should go to college.  Just understand that you are paying for that experience, and the value you get from it might not be in dollars.\nLikely, you value a mix of these things, and probably others as well.  The TL;DR of this advice is that you should make sure to understand the benefits that you expect to get out of college \n you decide to go.  That is the only way that you can evaluate whether or not it is worth the cost to you.  If you see no benefit, then no cost will be worth it."], "type": ["COMMENT"]}

My grandmother's obituary was the first result - she had died 6 months before and no one told me. I then went into hysterics for a good few days trying to process that. \nFor context, my mother was/is an alcoholic and I did not speak to that side of the family. She was in the process of taking me to court for saving her life when she attempted suicide and would send me lawyer letters biweekly, but never mentioned my grandmother's death. I was very close with her growing up but she refused to see me once my mother lost her job and descended into severe alcoholism. This still haunts me to this day. "], "type": ["COMMENT"]}

I've seen a dolphin do the most elegant backflip you've ever seen.  We caught a blue albatross as it went to dive for our gear.  When we pulled the bird in to release it, it was so unbelievably calm, we held its wings open to take a picture.  Massive birds those ones.\nAt the back while working gear, all of a sudden we see this black blade-like looking thing climb its way out of the water.  Once it reaches a height of roughly 6 feet, it comes slamming down into the water.  It does this maybe 5 or 6 times.  Hard to explain how bizarre it is seeing something like this until you've spent days/weeks/months staring off at water and seeing nothing.  It was the tail of a thresher shark that was climbing out of the water and trying to concuss the squid-like looking gear.\nBut honestly, one of the most amazing things is the bait ball.  It's caused by weather phenomena actually.  What happens is that herring and other feed fish predominantly survive in green, plankton filled water.  Their predators hate it for the most part because the plankton clogs gills and so on.  But what can happen is if blue and green water mix and due to temperature differences and a large amount of clear blue boils up from below, it can expose massive schools of feed fish.  Well once this happens, the entire ocean kicks into gear.  Tuna come over, dolphins come, sharks, seagulls and other birds - everybody's getting into it.  Below, they create this tightening circle of doom where they travel around the ball, keeping the feed fish from escaping.  Fins of all kinds breach the surface.  And just when we think we've seen everything, a massive humpback whale crashes the party.  It went directly through the center, destroying the ball, scattering the feed and all the predators."], "type": ["COMMENT"]}

I have a small farm and raise a lot of animals that I use to make some pretty high quality meals from. From that perspective, here's what I'd recommend: \nBulk Spices... You need to grow herbs so you have fresh ones available, but you also need to get yourself bulk spices for stuff you can't grow where you live. Having the right spices available makes your food taste legit. It's much cheaper than buying those little 1oz jars and always running out. \nGood oils and vinegars- You get in a routine of always buying the cheapest olive oil and the cheapest balsamic... you need to try better olive oils and other types of oil. You need to try good vinegar. There are very distinct differences and you can have a lot of subtle and unique flavors in your foods just from the cooking medium or what the vinegar is made from.\nMeat- If you can get high quality pork from a local, small-herd farmer... you have to do it. The spongy, pale, limp shit that passes for a pork chop or cutlet at the store is nothing like the deep red meat of a pastured pig marbled with milky white fat that in its right is a culinary treasure. I'm making a spread this weekend that is literally ground pork back fat whipped with black truffles and chestnut honey vinegar. Because the fat is from one of my own pigs, this bowl of lipid gluttony only has about 14 dollars worth of ingredients in it... but I look like mr fancy pants for having black truffles and high-falootin' vinegar. \nEggs- Have you ever had eggs from a chicken or a duck that literally lives its entire life on grass? If you live near somewhere that has people who raise pastured poultry, buy eggs from them. It's probably only a buck or two per dozen more than the \"good\" eggs from the grocery store.\nCookware- I have a 27 piece All-Clad cookware set and I use at least half of those on a weekly basis and the other half gets used monthly. It is the best pots and pans I've ever cooked on. I think the whole set cost something like 3 grand but I can't remember exactly. \nInduction cooktop- So this is getting kind of pricey, but the combination of an induction cooktop with those all-clad pans is amazing. Our's is a 6 burner Viking. 10 grand, so that's a little bit more than good vinegar.\nKitchenAid pro-line mixer- It's a remarkably solid piece of machinery and it makes mixing, bread kneading, sausage grinding, and pasta making a breeze. Skip the sausage stuffer attachment, though, because it's complete shit and get...\nLEM Sausage stuffer- Upright canister stuffer makes stuffing 5 lbs of sausage super easy. \nStihl Chainsaws- These things are a beast. I beat the living shit out of mine cutting 10-12 cords of hardwood every year in hilly, remote locations. My current Stihl cost 400 bucks. I would easily have gone through 3 cheaper saws and this one is still rock solid\nCheese- sorry for the brief aside into chainsaws. Cheese. Cheese is such an amazing food. The range of flavors, colors, aromas, and textures is limitless. But before you start paying MORE for cheese, just start by paying more for MORE cheese. Try lots of different kinds. Take notes, figure out what you like, and then try better samples of the things you like. See what you don't like, and try a small amount of a really good sample of it to see if you still don't like it or if you just like it when you buy the good stuff. \nI'm sure I could go on about a lot more, but that's a start"], "type": ["COMMENT"]}

They may also qualify you for a discount on your home insurance. They kick on automatically on an outage and usually run on natural gas. \n-Centrally Monitored Fire Detection - This one will most definitely garner you a discount on your home insurance. Many people don't realize that alarm systems come in three forms low-voltage, hard-wired, and battery. \nLow voltage are the ones that can be easily centrally monitored (calls the fire dept), you'll know these by red wires coming from your alarm panel (usually). These things have saved so many lives, prevented so much destruction. \nHard-wired are usually required by building codes and DO NOT call the fire department in pretty much every instance. They get you out of bed, and that's it. \nBattery is the same as hard-wired, only not permanently powered.\n-Bidet - From what I hear, these are just about the best thing ever for some reason (for women I guess). Also relatively easy to install.\n-Myson Towel Warmer - These things warm/dry your towels for you. Not much more needs to be said.

Many looked very....silly....and awkward.

They had a lot of shit I didn't like, but one kind of cool thing was their class registration system. Since it was such a small school, instead of registering for everything months ahead of time, you spent 3 days a week before the semester began going around and talking to professors who taught courses you were interested in. You scheduled 10-15 minute interviews with 'em in their office.  \nMy Freshman year I saw an intro to Shakespeare class, and since I liked most of what I've read of Shakespeare, I figured it could be fun. I interviewed the professor, a very short man named \"Kaiser\", and he was pleasant for most of the interview. He explained the class and then opened up for questions. One thing he mentioned was that plays were in different categories, such as comedies, romances, and dramas. I asked him what plays we'd be reading, and he listed \"The Tempest\" as one of the romances. I figured I wanted to take the class and thought it'd be cool to engage in some dialogue with my future professor, so I told him that I thought it was interesting, since we had studied the Tempest as a comedy when I was in high school.  \nThe mood died instantly. He first asked me very seriously what I meant, and when I started to explain, he exploded. He started screaming about how I was wrong and how could I POSSIBLY think the Tempest was a comedy and just started ranting. I was too astounded by this tiny man just freaking out at me and wasn't really registering a lot of what he said, but I ultimately did not register for his course.  \nLater I was telling the story to some Sophomore students, and told the story without saying the teacher's name. When they asked me who it was, I told them \"Kaiser\", and they all just nodded knowingly.  \nTL;DR: Got accosted by a dwarf over an innocent question about Shakespeare."], "type": ["COMMENT"]}

While in Cape Cod, right off the shore of Nauset beach near East Orleans about 7 years ago, I was on the family boat, a 24 foot Grady white. We were sitting there looking at the seals in the water feeding on some sort of bait fish when we saw one of them split off the pack. Now, keep in mind that we were almost 100 yards away, so we were surprised to see that this seal was headed our way, he must have been very interested. It didn\u2019t take more than 30 seconds for this guy to come right up to the side of the boat we were on, and I kid you not, it just treaded water and looked at us for about five minutes. We were all taking pictures and \u201ctalking\u201d to this kind visitor as most people would do, all while he calmly watched us. After we had put down our cameras and sat back down, still watching our new friend, he swam off and went back to his seal buddies to continue feeding. It was truly an amazing experience for myself.

I have a coworker who's situation is very, very similar to yours. I think there's a lot more people in your shoes than you think.\nThe first thing you need to do is give yourself credit for taking a new job across the country. That takes serious guts to do. I've traveled around the world and hiked miles through swamps in Southeast Asia but I don't think I could relocate out of state. Some people just aren't cut out for that.\nThe next thing you need to do is find a better substitute for that show. Have you watched Planet Earth before? It's really an incredible documentary that would be a great way for you to replace time spent watching your old show with something nice and relaxing. Plus it probably has some pretty sweet owls.\nNext thing you should do is pick up a hobby. Let's start with something simple: try and grow a plant. You can pick up a basil plant in Trader Joe's for roughly $5 and it doesn't have the long-term commitment that a real pet has. Again, I'm not expecting you to become a botanist here, but I just want you to set a goal and try your best to exceed it. My plant died after two weeks so try and keep yours alive longer than that.  \nFinally, we need to make some changes to your daily routine. Wake up every morning on the early side....no later than 7am. As soon as you wake up go on a short run. This is a great way to start your day in a way that will put you in a good state of mind. As soon as you get back start to plan out your day. Even if you have absolutely nothing going on in your life block off time to do laundry, go grocery shopping, go to work, or watch Planet Earth. This is about taking control of your life so you feel in charge of it.\nLast, but not least, think about making some even bigger changes. Try looking for a new job in your area. Maybe try taking a new course online or at your community college to move in a different career direction. Ironically enough, things can \"come together\" when you least expect it.\nWhich brings me to my last point, don't lose hope. Life is full of places like Reddit where everyone tries to be \"pragmatic\" and \"clever\" when really it's just a bunch of cynical 20-somethings trying to make sense of things. Optimistic people always do better than pessimistic people in the long run. Try everything I mentioned above and give it a shot for a couple months.\nBest of Luck! And send a photo of the plant my way if it stays alive more than ten days... "], "type": ["COMMENT"]}

I actually already have a plant, \n a pet, both of which are alive! I know, amazing. For me, anyway. \nI think the main issue is sometimes the physical loneliness. Not just a lack of intimacy, but a lack of people around in general. I've tried making plans with my coworkers (even to the point of inviting myself along when they go out), but it never works out. They're a very tight-knit bunch, and seem adverse to the idea of someone \"new\" joining their group. It's very clique-ish. The problem is, I work so much, I don't ever go anywhere or have time to meet other people. \nI think the TV star boyfriend fantasy lingers (hell, \n) because of a lack of intimacy. I haven't had a real \n since before I moved here. Not like a mom hug, like a \"more than friends\" hug. Something that lasts longer than 3 seconds. It sounds so theatrical, but sometimes I just need to be held. Or touched in any way, really. To me, the physical loneliness drives my obsessive fantasy state just as much as the emotional side. \nWith work, without getting too specific, I am on a timed contract. I have a couple years left of this type of work (long hours almost every day) in the promise of something better once it's over. It's insane, in a very competitive field, but the rewards are plentiful if you put in 4-5 years of hell first. There is no such thing as free time. \nThe thing I worry about, and that prompted me to write this post, was the strong emotions I am feeling for someone who I don't know and have never met, and how important this fantasy has become in my life. Honestly, it's pitiful and scary to me- I'm having \n emotional reactions (heart racing, stomachache, etc.) surrounding someone I've \n met and probably never will! That's nuts! I've tried to replace it with so many things- music, artistic hobbies, etc. It persists. I'll try some of your suggestions, though, about maybe making a couple hours a week for exercise or another type of program, and hopefully it can help. Thank you so much once again.

One of my jobs was being a lookout to spot boats, planes, things in the water or air pretty much and report it back to the ship. My Lookout rotation could have me standing watch during the day or night sometimes both and it was during the nights where I was pretty afraid especially if you were at the back of the ship alone. For anyone who hasn't been out in the middle of the ocean in the middle of the night should realize you see many more lights in the sky than you would ever in a city. And on Navy ships they like to have very little lights on at night so standing watch around 1am feels very alien sometimes. And during the nights without a bright moon to help with your vision, you may as well be on a different planet. There was this one time I saw bright green color moving in the water slowly and I didn't know what it was. My mind told me maybe it's a USO or something else. Eventually I was told it was just plankton but it sure looked freaky to someone who wasn't aware of the glowing plankton produces. Another time me and another guy were standing watch together and I decided just to look up during 2am and see what things I would come across the midnight sky. I would see meteors streak across the sky but a couple of times there were bright lights moving slowly way out there. Perhaps a satellite, maybe who knows. But I stared for a good 20 minutes in the sky and encountered approximately 15 of those slow moving lights in different areas of the sky perhaps many millions of miles apart. Either way those were the few times I saw for myself how vast space really is and that there was so much unknowns out there that humans have yet to discover or explain. "], "type": ["COMMENT"]}

It was 150$+ for a person to spend an entire day with elephants, and it is one of like 3 respectable elephant experiences in Thailand.

We got to ride them, feed them, bathe them and learn about how to take care of them and stuff.\nThe second was for a cruise in Vietnams Ha Long Bay. There are qutie a few cruises but me and my boyfriend decided on the much more expensive cruise. It was really quite fancy with giant meals and beautiful rooms, and obviously gorgeous scenery. They had interesting and personal activities for us as well. The best part of it was we opted for a Village stay in rural Vietnam. It was extra but we were the only ones who did it, and we got to stay in a beautiful traditional Vietnamese house with giant meals and we got to tour the town and market with a lady who grew up there. It was probably the best thing that happened out of the 5 month trip.\nTrust me, you can travel on a budget, but do your research!

His kids have rooms in my parents house and in the trailer, but they spend 99% of their time here.\nMy brother CONSTANTLY has randos staying in that trailer, probably in exchange for drugs, doesn't pay rent, doesn't stick around, constantly gets his car stolen, and my poor dad just keeps supporting him. \n\"What am I going to do? What can I do?\" my father says. \nThese random people staying in that trailer, they are downtrodden drug addicts, too. They don't really come up to our house, but my brother has a key and appears in the middle of the night to steal lunchmeat or cold hot dogs from the fridge, or, when he's using meth, entire bottles of soda. \nWe don't keep regular light bulbs or tin foil in the house anymore. My dad has a gigantic BOX of spoons he keeps on hand to replace the stolen ones.\nThat girl.... the girl who died.... she was sweet, she was CLEAN, she didn't have kids, she worked, she loved my brother's children.... she was a nice lady. \nAnd my brother completely 1000000% blames himself. He will never be the same. My brother's brain is fried from heroin, meth, pills, and god knows what. His PTSD is so severe and he turned to the only medication he figured would work to soothe the pain of losing the ONE thing that he felt held him together. \nFor almost three of these five years, my father and I sign off on report cards, go to the stupid school meetings, and I put my entire life on hold to help my family instead of escape my family. I was the one who went to college, I was the one who had a career. I was the one who was going to break free.\nBut now I've been disabled, and both of my hips are messed up, and I've been reduced to not being able to do 1/10th of the things I was doing to help this family. I've become part of the problem.\nAnd here we languish. \nAnd my brother is a ghost. He doesn't draw perfectly scaled drawings of cars from memory with 100% accuracy. He doesn't get out his 6-string and play every Green Day song from the 90s from memory, he doesn't write music anymore, he doesn't remember playing Bad Dudes with me on NES, he doesn't enjoy anything.\nI hate him. I hate this shitty heroin addict, theiving, lying, worthless shit of a father that this person who lives 100 yards away has become. \nBut can you imagine? Just fleeting experiences with other drug addicts, people you don't know, don't care to know, but by necessity of getting the next fix you are inclined to interact with. People who are have a warrant out for ten years of unpaid child support for their five kids? Spaced out of your mind and every interaction is just a surface conversation out of pure desire to stay sane with the next dose? Walking ten miles down a highway in the rain because your \"friend\" who \"knows a guy\" in the shit part of town stole your car, again, and you know the address of \"this guy\" so you'll just walk at midnight in the rain, ten miles, just to get a balloon? And you don't know this \"guy\", and sometimes they will beat the shit out of you and send you on your way, sometimes they will rob you of the twenty you stole from your retired, disabled father's wallet in the middle of the night, SOMETIMES you will be in the wrong place at the wrong time and get shanked by a gangbanger, hitchhike home, bleeding, and get another \"friend\" to stitch you up with upholstery thread and a lidocaine patch your nursing assistant \"friend\" jacked from the nursing home? And none of this fucking PHASES you, none of it emotionally disturbs you.\nAll you FEEL is hollow, because you need another hit, you REQUIRE IT, or the dope sickness will set in and you'll be eating immodium and magnesium tablets and feasting on mountains of donuts, all stolen from your retired, disabled father's house, going through every contact on your Obamaphone, calling people you've used and abused in the past, calling people who've made you suck their dick for a quarter of a gram, which isn't enough, but hey, they cum quick, right? Desperation sets in as you furiously text everyone while you languish in your unmade bed and cold sweats coat your emaciated body.\nTHIS IS THE LITTLE BOY I GREW UP WITH. He was my BROTHER.\nI can't IMAGINE a more LONELY existence. I miss him so much, and HE'S BEEN RIGHT HERE ALL ALONG."], "type": ["COMMENT"]}

I had three roomates, who were really cool guys but I never really became good friends with them and believe me I tried and they did too but you know how it is not everyone can become good friends with everyone. Anyway, the three of them were best buds and they threw a party and seeing as I lived there ofcourse I was invited. Anyway, a bunch of their friends come over, everybody is chilling, having a good time, alcohol, drinking games and whatnot. And I'm doing what I usually do at parties which is just sit there and sip my drink and maybe work up the nerve to talk to someone new.\nNow usually I would've just started drinking more until the fear was gone but earlier that year I had pulled the same thing when I went out with the roommates and ended up blacking out and vomiting on my clothes. So I was afraid of drinking too much and was really just working through two beers in over two hours, practically sober and just hoping not to look like a giant loser infront of all these people, and especially my roommates in my own house. Except I knew that's exactly what I looked like. I was literally the only person in the room not in a conversation, too scared to start one I guess. Everyone else like me had already left but since this was my house I couldn't. \nThis was a smallish apartment. One big living room/kitchen with a corridor that led to all the bedrooms and the two bathrooms. So everyone was in this one big living-room. After something like three hours of this I just decided to go to my room and go to bed, except I didn't go to bed. I knew I couldn't, I have a hard time sleeping as is. With how fucking ashamed I felt then and the fact that it wasn't even midnight I knew I wouldn't be able to sleep. So I went in my room, turned off the light and pretended to be asleep, mindlessly browsing the web on my computer to keep myself from crying the whole time.\nAfter a couple of hours, it was around one, the party had died down a bit but there was still a good bit of action going on outside my door and I had to piss. Like really, really bad. I had been holding it in for quite a while. The bathroom was literally across the corridor from my room. All I had to do was open my door and take two steps and I'd be in the bathroom. I could do my business and go back to my room. But I couldn't. I just couldn't. They would see me. They would see that I was awake the whole time and just sitting in my room like a huge fucking loser. If I had no other choice I would've gone out. But that day I just couldn't. \nIn my room I had big jar of peanutbutter which was washed clean and being used to store sugar, I emptied the sugar into a plastic bag. Then I pissed into the empty jar until it was full and closed the lid. I still had to pee but it had relieved enough tension that I could manage for an hour or two. Then I just sat there looking at my blank desktop thinking about what the fuck was wrong with me. I mean this was a serious fucking problem that I was too scared to take two fucking steps into the fucking bathroom. Anyway that was the loneliest I've ever felt and I still feel lonely very often and if I was put in the same situation again, I think I would still do the same thing.\nLater that night, after maybe another hour or so everyone left, my roommates went to their rooms and I finally came out of my room. I took a piss, emptied the jar into the toilet, closed it back up and tossed it in the trash. Then I went back to my room and cried for a while in bed before finally going to sleep. \nI've never told anyone this."], "type": ["COMMENT"]}

Maybe a few folks will read it and it will make a difference. \nMy saddest and loneliest moment was the last hour or so of my mom's life. She passed this last June after living with Multiple Sclerosis for around 30 years, having taken her last step 20 years ago. \nIn the hospital when we all knew it was over me, my sisters, and my dad gathered in her room. Prayed with her and said our goodbyes, so to speak. She was comatose by this point, having not spoken or responded in over a day. \nAfter the gloom of the prayers had subsided everyone else decided to go to my dad's house to eat. They generally seemed to be in a good mood. I don't think they were realizing that when they left the room they'd never see her alive again. They were laughing about things and chatting. But I was sullen and didn't want to join in their atmosphere. They started to gather their things and go and I pulled up a chair beside my mom's bed and took her hand. My dad seemed surprised.\n\"Aren't you coming?\" He asked. \n\"No, I'll stay a little longer.\" I said. \"You all need to go to the store and get the food so I'll head up there later.\" I wasn't going anywhere though. I was staying with her til the end.\nMy mom, even though highly religious, had always been afraid of dying. I knew that she did not want to die alone even if she had no idea I was there. I also knew that no one else wanted to be there for her last breathe and so I understood why the others were leaving. My younger sister texted me and asked if I was staying with her until the end. I told her yes, that I would make the call when it was over. \nI sat in silence holding her hand and comforting her. I always knew it would be like this. She and I were very close and I had helped her in some emergency situations before, some difficult or embarrassing accidents that can happen with someone who has no control over their body. I always knew I would be the one to help her pass on too. It was a sense of duty to her. If the table was turned she would be the one holding my hand. \nNonetheless, that last hour, where she lay taking one breath every minute or so, was the saddest and loneliest I've ever felt. The only comfort I found was that in the few days prior when she could still respond, I would ask her if she felt afraid. She would tell me no and that she was ok. So I knew that she realized what was happening. She spent her last thoughts praying, and being highly Christian, committing herself to God's arms.\nI started to cry at one point. She took 2 quick breaths instead of one. I stopped crying and told her I wouldn't do that again. Maybe she knew I was there? It was the only time she took 2 breaths. Either way, I didn't do it again. Instead I just stroked her arm and reassured her we'd all be fine. She passed a few minutes later. I went ahead and cried then. \nI want to pass on 3 pieces of my experience in hopes they'll help others. I'm 37 years old so I'm not someone naive and this wasn't my first loss. However, it did effect me profoundly and I think about these things every day. \n1) I had turned cynical about religion as I grew older. But in those moments when my mom's fear turned into calm acceptance I realized that she passed into heaven. And I'm not talking about a place in the clouds with streets of gold and mansions. But in her last days on earth she put the pain, suffering, and fear behind her and relied on her faith. I no longer hold that cynicism towards people that choose those beliefs. And I firmly believe my mom is in heaven, although that particular concept of heaven may be different. \n2) staying with someone as they pass is the most difficult, sad, and lonely experience. Do not do it if you're unsure. It's an experience that you can't let go of or forget. While being with her was something I knew she wanted and I felt compelled to do I truly wish it had happened another way. I'm not saying you shouldn't do it if you want to be there. Just be prepared to live with it. It is very unpleasant. \n3) in the days that followed as I sat in my kitchen listening to \"In The Garden\", her favorite hymn, and writing her eulogy I got tons of messages from friends and colleagues. I had always been one to attend funerals for friends and loved ones who experienced loss. All of these people reached out to me. Those messages and that comfort meant a lot to me. Please take the time to reach out to folks who lose someone, even if it's a pet. It is extraordinarily helpful while dealing with such profound grief. \nThanks for reading.  Love you, mom.

He almost convinced me to drop out of my journalism degree and switch to economics. (I know: \"you should have anyway\", \"dying field\", blah blah blah)\nThis professor, oh man... he was so ditzy that he was comparable to your typical horror movie blonde girl (I say this as a twentysomething blonde girl, mind you). Every one of his lectures consisted of vague platitudes, memes, and cat pictures, and our lectures were titled things like \"curiosity is important!\" He never taught us any of the following journalism basics: interview techniques, the difference between a good news article and a bad one, journalism history, elementary media law, creative commons rules, sourcing and arbitration basics, Associated and Canadian Press style rules, photography or videography tips, basic web programming for online journalism, etc. None of this was even glossed over. Now, this would have been \n if it was a bird course in a bird program, where the professor gave you easy tests and easy projects in tune with the crap value of his lectures. Nope. It was the most prestigious program at my liberal arts university -- you needed a 90%+ high school average, extracurriculars, etc. to be considered for entry. In addition, we had to maintain an A- average to avoid being kicked out of the program, and the course itself was our major class (the most important one we would take during first year). After a half semester of his teaching, I tried to switch my degree to economics because I felt, in journalism, I was paying $12,000 a year to learn absolutely nothing. A grad school professor blocked my switch, came to talk to me, and told me \"just wait till after Christmas, and then think about it\" (we got a new professor after Christmas who was excellent and I started learning lots). To cap it off, my first year prof was a BRUTAL marker and tester.\nFor example, we used to have weekly quizzes on current news -- this is fairly common in journalism school, to make sure students are keeping up with current affairs. A typical news quiz might look something like this (my questions are a bit out of date, sorry):\nQ: What Hamilton, Ont. member of parliament was involved in a scandal over Auschwitz this week? (A: Alex Johnstone)\nQ: What is the name of the hurricane currently ravaging Mexico? (A: Patricia)\nQ: What has Habs player P.K. Subban done recently to get him in the news? (A: donated $10 million to Montreal children's hospital)\nQ: How many cabinet ministers has Prime Minister Justin Trudeau appointed to his cabinet, and what is special about them? (A: 30 ministers, and it's the first cabinet with equal gender representation)\nWell, this professor gave us news quizzes with the most random, obscure questions on them. He once asked us about a quote within a specific documentary about Stephen Harper. None of us had seen the documentary. It wasn't screened in class, assigned to the readings, or even mentioned offhand by our professor in class. It was not a \"big news\" film and hadn't been extensively covered by Globe and Mail, Toronto Star, or other major news outlets. Every one of us failed this question because what the fuck???\nSome of my other favourite things he did:"], "type": ["COMMENT"]}

He came back the day of the midterm and took it but got a horrible grade due to not having been able to study from all the stress and trauma of the past few days. He emailed our professor to explain the situation, who responded with \"Unless your dad is actually dying right now, this isn't a valid excuse and you'll just have to deal with your grade.\"\nHis dad \"actually died\" around 6 months later after being bedridden and unable to even communicate for several of those months.

I listen to music that I would listen to when I made those treks back in the day. I also pretend to still hold conversations with her when I'm driving back home as if I came to pick her up. My family doesn't know that I do this, don't know that most of the time when I leave the house for an hour or two on the weekend, that this is what I do. I also visit places we used to frequent, so there's that to. Go the mall or a movie by myself which can be nice, but it's still a really lonely time. I sometimes pretend that she's there in the bookstore with me, and I just lost track of her, so I look around hoping to find her, nose in a book, and she looks up at me and smiles. I have, like three friends, but one of them is living in another state and rarely visits, and my other two friends are busy with their own lives to really make time for me anymore. I only really cling onto my old memories of my last relationship because it's all i really have left. I haven't had a genuine happy moment since we broke up. It's been almost two years. I know that it'll get better or whatever, but until then, I'll just keep on being lonely. \nAlso, sorry for the horrible structure and possible spelling errors. I just needed to put this out there. Also sorry for wasting anyone's time if they don't find this interesting or up to par or whatever. Yeah, okay bye. \nAddition: In response to everyone's overwhelming awesome responses and messages, I will address them here, I guess, rather than individually. I feel it'd be better this way. \nTo those people saying I need to get out more, perhaps trying to get back on the dating scene: Yeah, I've tried. I've had countless encounters, online and IRL, but they all seem to crumble, mainly due to my unwillingness to get over my ex, and also because they just don't end up liking me. Some days I do feel ready to get back out there, meet someone new, but most days I feel like it's futile. I have a small sliver of hope that maybe she's out there, and I'll meet this new wonderful person and it'll be great. I also realize how kinda unhealthy that is, too. I shouldn't just rely on someone else for happiness, it's something I need to work on, and something I'll address in my next point. \nTo those who say I need to seek help: Yeah, I most definitely agree. It's actually what I've been doing at the moment. I've been trying to find a decent therapist to talk to. I just want to make sure it's the right person. \nTo those who are in a similar situation as me: It'll get better. We need to work on getting better. It's not something that'll just happen one day. We need to talk to someone, find a hobby, meet new people. I'll try if you do. Let's do this together. \nTo Everyone: THANK YOU ALL. IT MADE MY DAY A LOT BETTER. "], "type": ["COMMENT"]}
