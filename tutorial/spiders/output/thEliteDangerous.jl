I understand that the paintjobs are mainly to gather more money for development, which i understand, but i feel the ships in game lack a level of personalisation for people who don't want to spend real money on paintjobs. Maybe keep the more fancy and flash paintjobs for real money purchases, and keep basic, flat colours for in-game purchases. Are there plans for more ship personalisation in the future? Thanks.

That I can always come to this sub for good discussion, specific info on current events, funny relevant posts, and community-involved moderators and FDev employees gives some good grounding (hopefully Horizons makes that grounding better [groan]) for a particularly awesome community.
