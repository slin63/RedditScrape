I count them as separate civilizations because their culture/government is distinct (same reason why I'm iffy about the Danish crown). There's also a difference between the Roman Republic and Roman Empire, obviously.\nThe Kush kingdom in Northern Africa lasted for a long long time, eventually becoming part of Egypt (Northern?).\nSimilarly to China, Egypt had many dynasties but the main reason it was disqualified is the change of main ruling parties in periods of less than 1000 years. Apparently, monarchs weren't as important and regional lords came in power. That signifies to me a change of culture due to changes in social hierarchy.\n1,000 years of none to very little change doesn't happen often because the geopolitical and socioeconomic landscape change. You still see similarities in the budded civilizations that may remind you of a parent culture but oftenly, there's enough differences in beliefs, rituals, language, and art to warrant it as a new civilizations. \nFor clarity, the criteria I used were civilizations that maintained one form of government (democracy, theocracy, monarchy...) and mostly had their territories (as long as they held their capital, without changing places due to change of government) without any major changes to culture (like Chinese emperors' order to destroy previous dynasty's stuff) throughout their continuous existence."], "type": ["COMMENT"]}

The other parties can't make a coaltion because they contain one kurdish interest party and one violently nationalist party.

Both programs have had two fatal accidents, although the Soyuz has had far more launches.\nThe thing with the N1 was that the original designer, Sergei Korolev, was a total genius.  He designed a VERY complex rocket because Soviet engines tended to be smaller and less powerful (but notably more efficient) than US engines.  As a result, the N1 had \n engines.  The piping and wiring was insanely complex.\nThe original concept seems to have been functional enough, but, unfortunately for the rocket, Korolev died in 1966 and the attempts to figure out his plans didn't go well.

Many benfits of the EU are not explicit. The negatives, on the other site, are very explicit. Cost of housing is very high. Fierce competition in the job market. A taxed health system.

The EU provided a constant influx of well educated young labour benefited the UK. Unlike Germany or Sweden, the UK does not face a 'demographic timebomb'. The educated labour created one of the strongest economies relying on services. It may not be easy to tell how much they benefit the country, but I can tell you for sure that the country would be worse of without out them. Only the common goods marketand the common labour of the EU make this possible. \nEveryone with a basic understanding of economics can tell you that UKIP's idea of 'We can achieve the same with trade agreements' is simply wrong."], "type": ["COMMENT"]}

In any dictatorship there are people who, even if you take them into a safe space amenable to clear reflection, will still think the goals and methods of a dictatorship are right and good.  So the dissenters are ruled by fear, but what's scary is that you'll always find people who simply just agree with the policy, including the methods, without any fear.\nSo I think while fear is an important element, it isn't as simple as making everyone really scared, if you want to run a successful dictatorship."], "type": ["COMMENT"]}

So yes, it will happen, especially since Russia needs to renew its fleet of strategic bombers.\nAs far as the carrier, Russians have produced all the designs, and after what basically amounted to building a brand new carrier for India, they have the technology and the experience. Russia also has a ton of experience with nuclear powered ships. The issue is that carriers are expensive and most level-headed military people in Russia realize that Russian Navy has no need for one. Russia is mostly a land power, it has no bases outside, and one does not need carriers for coastal defense. In fact, the carrier that they do field now is more of a heavy missile cruiser with some aircraft, and is more suited for fleet defense - meaning that while your classical supercarrier needs a group of destroyers/frigates to defend it, Russian design does not - if anything, it will be the one defending the destroyers. The downside is it sucks at bombing and power projection.\nTL;DR; What you are hearing is not \"propaganda meant to appease Russian audience\". These designs do exist, some are being worked on, some are not. There is no agreement in Russian military as to how they should develop, and often echoes of those arguments and plans that are made and scrapped monthly make it to the news one way or the other."], "type": ["COMMENT"]}

Initially, the US said there were militants firing from the building, then quickly walked it back to \"Afghan forces asked for air support, we don't know what happened.\" In this recent strike, Saudi Arabia is denying they hit the building at all. The US and KSA have refused international investigations into the respective incidents.\nSo it's difficult to know what to conclude at this point.

He hasn't gotten enough votes for his party in parliament though, so he can't do that. "], "type": ["COMMENT"]}

They can't be protected forever sure, but there's a reason we don't show autopsy docusoaps next to cartoons.\n*Edit: I had another thought regarding your everyday porn. Given how little we teach kids about sex, most of their pre-experience lessons come from School, TV and film, throw too much porn into the mix and they could develop fantasies and habits more in line with scripted fetishism winding them or others in trouble (if not acted upon appropriately, there's a time and a place for many things as long as everyone affected agrees wholeheartedly). When kids are flying around the garden with a bin bag superman cape, how would they make the distinction between consenting, paid actors (if we're lucky in their choice of porn), and real relationships and sexual expectations. At best they're expecting inappropriate responses to workplace gestures (thankfully now a sackable offence, but the aggressor also becomes a victim of their own attitude). For any future daughter, she may learn that her role in life whatever her job is to bend over backwards (literally) for her boss, to flirt with her teacher, to believe her being and achievements always belong to a man. My future daughter might learn that from porn indirectly, having those values imposed by what others teach her from their experiences.

Netanyahu didn't say anything false, he just said something true, but silly, and allowed false implications to be drawn.

This is all true. The \"final solution\" wasn't formulated until later. Why it's silly is because the German Jewish population was only a fraction of the Jews killed in the holocaust and the Levant wasn't the only place that refused to take exiled German Jews. That's true of pretty much everywhere and happens to be one of the popular justifications for zionism. Had their been an Israel, somebody would have taken them.\nNetanyahu took heat over the implications of what he said. The implication that he wanted you to draw was that the Palestinian people's hatred of the Jews predated any real mass immigration and it's fundamentally grounded in irrational racism. The implication the media drew was Hitler saying \"huh, kill the Jews? Never thought of that before. Good idea. I'll get right on that.\" That's even sillier than what Netanyahu said.

Most \"loli\" characters are just shrunken women. \nOne also very telling fact about anime/manga that depict these \"little kids\" is that usually, there is a very convenient excuse that makes them not actually children. Watchers of anime and readers of manga, even if they enjoy depictions of loli characters, find the idea of romanticized children repulsive. Therefore, writers of these materials get around it somehow, usually with a fucking stupid excuse but I digress. Art style makes \n. \n. \nOne also has to note the cultural difference between America and Japan. Japan has a much bigger \"cute culture\" than America does. It's usually much better for a girl to be considered 'cute' than 'hot' in Japan. Cuteness tends to come with infantilization - they go hand in hand. \nIn general, I find anime and manga are two forms of art that are generally more freely expressive than western comic books and TV shows when it comes to taboo materials. Banning certain types of expression from them would be an overall loss of a great area of artistic expression. For example, I once read a manga called Koi Kaze, about a long-lost brother and sister who meet each other and fall in love. That type of shit would never be made where I live, but it was actually a pretty beautiful and heartbreaking story. Even anime that were dubbed into English for distribution on US television networks had their themes censored. Cardcaptors comes to mind - the theme of the show was the power of love, and it meant all kinds of love - romantic love, familial love, homosexual love, (romantic) love between cousins, love between people of vastly different ages, etc. That overall theme was destroyed by the dub because it was thought people couldn't handle it."], "type": ["COMMENT"]}

The ndrangheta managed to get a huge chunk of their former power and then some. They now control a considerable part of the traffic of cocaine in the West. Compared to the Sicilian mafia they are more business-like and much harder to fight (their organization is more based on actual families of relatives compared to the Sicilian \"families\", and thus harder to infiltrate)"], "type": ["COMMENT"]}

There were 2 main investigations named \"Ergenekon\" and \"Balyoz\". Ergenekon targeted journalists, civillian people, Balyoz targeted soldiers. AKP supported those arrests. When all of this happening, all of the opposition parties (biggest ones) like CHP, MHP and HDP (BDP) blamed G\u00fclen Movement for these charges. They denied the evidences, called them fake. They also said G\u00fclen Movement was behind all of this. That made sense because everybody in Turkey knows G\u00fclen Movement is so powerful in police force and courts.\nFast forward, few years earlier G\u00fclen Movement and AKP had a fight -reasons unknown- and some new investigation about corruption in AKP came up. Even evidences were on internet, someone from police force leaked them. We're not sure how much of it was true (i think most of it were) but main target of that investigation was AKP. And it's not conspiracy, everybody agreed on this was a move by G\u00fclen Movement. So, G\u00fclen Movement arrested many people by forging fake evidences, after they had a fight with AKP they done the same thing for AKP.\nAgain, i'm not making these up, only thing that everyone can agree on Turkey is G\u00fclen Movement was behind those things. There are 3 biggest opposition parties in Turkey, all of them are against G\u00fclen Movement.\nSo, there is an organization which controls the police force, courts, forging fake evidences and arresting people. Those two TV stations were owned by that G\u00fclen Movement. They are not innocent at all. They are not journalists. They are just an illegal organization.\nThere are so many opposition newspapers and TV stations in Turkey. Biggest media group is anti AKP and they are doing pretty good."], "type": ["COMMENT"]}

This meant that, and ironically under the pretense of getting into the EU amongst other reasons, his party kept passing legislation that reigned in the power that the military held over civil institutions while also reducing their budgets significantly. This culminated to the arrests of top military personnel in 2012 over a purported coup attempt named Sledgehammer against Erdogan, which really neutered the military. In a weakened position, if the army pushes for a coup at the present moment, there is risk for a civil uprising in return, and I can't put in words the clusterf*ck that would lead to for not only Turkey but the region as well. \nThere are some positives however. Erdogan's AKP party wasn't a majority in this year's elections in June. Erdogan's AKP refused to form a coalition and because of that, there'll be elections next month once again, with a majority not a certainty once again for the AKP. Erdogan will either have to settle for a coalition or backtrack on his own reasoning for reigning in the military, ie, for democracy. The other positive is that with ISIS knocking about and the Kurds in Turkey getting agitated due to Erdogan railing against Kurds in Syria, he has had to hand some power back in the form of better budgets to the military as well as see some faith getting restored in the military. This is how things stand currently and lets see what happens in November. "], "type": ["COMMENT"]}

According to the Commission, \"between 1988 and 2004, the companies rigged bids for procurement contracts, fixed prices, allocated projects to each other, shared markets and exchanged commercially important and confidential information.\" Siemens was given the highest fine of \u20ac396 million, more than half of the total, for its alleged leadership role in the incident.\nSiemens agreed to pay a record $1.34 billion in fines in December 2008 after being investigated for serious bribery. The investigation found questionable payments of roughly \u20ac1.3 billion, from 2002 to 2006 that triggered a broad range of inquiries in Germany, the United States and many other countries. In May 2007 a German court convicted two former executives of paying about \u20ac6 million in bribes from 1999 to 2002 to help Siemens win natural gas turbine supply contracts with Enel, an Italian energy company. The contracts were valued at about \u20ac450 million. Siemens was fined \u20ac38 million.\nNokia Siemens supplied telecommunications equipment to the Iranian telecom company that included the ability to intercept and monitor telecommunications, a facility known as \"lawful intercept\". The equipment was believed to have been used in the suppression of the 2009\u20132010 Iranian election protests, leading to criticism of the company, including by the European Parliament. Nokia-Siemens later divested its call monitoring business, and reduced its activities in Iran.\nSiemens has been accused of bribing Greek officials. In 2008, it was revealed that Siemens had bribed the two main political parties of Greece for approximately 10 years to be the sole provider of mechanical and electrical equipment of the Greek state. After the exposure the German authorities moved to arrest the representatives of Siemens in Greece, who had managed to escape from the Greek authorities. The German judicial system didn't allow the Greek authorities to cross-question the representatives. As a result, there wasn't any solid evidence against the corrupt politicians, who weren't arrested and continue to be active in the Greek political system. Meanwhile, the Greek state cancelled the planned business deals.)  "], "type": ["COMMENT"]}

They should be on par with murderers, because, in many cases, they are. \nThat might seem harsh, but I am just sock and tired of corporations doing all this evil shit in pursuit of profits and something drastic needs to be done to stop it. It is just  out of control. "], "type": ["COMMENT"]}

One has planes flying overhead then a motorcycle bomb explodes near the hospital. The other two are legit though. However, those are not MSF hospitals but more like field hospitals; e.g. their coordinates are not really known to pilots. I am not sure whether they have a red cross painted on the roof (as they should), that would prevent a lot of strikes from happening. The big difference is that MSF provides GPS locations of their sites to all parties involved.\nRussia never denied using cluster bombs in Syria. They (as well as us) did not sign any treaty against it, and use them - we did use them in Iraq, as well. While mostly cluster bombs are used by Syrian Army in MLRS and their air force, to my knowledge Russia used unguided cluster bombs on some occasions in mountains/deserert, as well as RBK-500 SPBE-D thermal guided cluster bombs within/near cities. The latter present little danger to civilians and bystanders, they are HEAT munitions which activate when thermal sensors figure out a tank/large vehicle is in range and the bomb guides itself towards it. I guess you could get hurt if it hit a truck and you were next to it as the gas tank exploded, but that's about it."], "type": ["COMMENT"]}

Getting the money through the government, which can distribute it through social services, is one way to be compensated (whether that happens effectively is another question).\nAlso the lines about cleaning up and leaving the country as pristine as Texaco found it and that the deleterious effects of the pollution only started once they were out of the country (again, even if true, not proof of innocence) is standard Chevron PR, not to say it's not true, but it is worth taking with a grain of salt."], "type": ["COMMENT"]}

Harper severely muzzled the scientific community, Bill C51 and C24 were huge backwards steps for citizens' rights, he defanged the investigative wing of Elections Canada, he bought hard into the scam that was the F35 program, and did his damnedest to stall and stop the NSPS which is huge for the Navy, since we're technically a 6th-rate Navy at this point... Not to mention the robocalling scandal that happened during the last election, plus the whole Mike Duffy scandal, and he backpedaled on reform of the Canadian Senate. That's just what I can think of off the top of my head here, I'm sure someone out there has a well-sourced list of Harper failures and stagnation throughout his terms as PM.\nLike, seriously guys? I'll be the first to admit I'm pretty left-wing, but if your party has repeated scandals and constantly fails to deliver on promises made during elections, I think it's time to reconsider your blind loyalty to your party.

It's easier to be a thief than to be a productive member of society.  People that follow the golden rule restrain themselves, because they respect others as themselves. These people don't often end up in prison.\nLaws and law enforcement are created for those who do not restrain their selfish urges. They do not chose to follow the golden rule. So, in order to protect the peace, harmony, joy and freedom of others, we have agreed that these people must be restrained. They can be any of us, if we so choose to disregard others in our personal quest for satisfaction in life.\nThat being said, we should never allow law enforcement to become a force that needlessly tramples others' peace, harmony, joy and freedom for some illusory, perceived protection from those who would choose not to restrain their selfish urges. We should always ask ourselves when making laws and applying law enforcement two basic questions. Who are we \n protecting? Who are we \n harming? The answers will clarify the merit of our actions.\nSo, in this case, who are we protecting and who are we hurting? "], "type": ["COMMENT"]}
