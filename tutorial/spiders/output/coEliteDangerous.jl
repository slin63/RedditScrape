The only thing to work towards is ships, and relatively speaking, it's much easier to access that content than in other MMO games.\nHowever, the problem is that it is the only thing worth spending money on and progressing towards.  Powerplay was stupid in that their only incentive was big money and ways that changed money flow into player pockets.

Going out on a limb here but fuck any game that has that kind of DLC model to begin with, let alone \"freemium\" microtransactions.  \nElite isn't that type of game, not by far, but I think even paid cosmetics tread a stupidly fine line if you're not a F2P game, much less if you offer yourself as a full game to begin with, then have no way of actually creating an identity past your CMDR name in universe.  Just something to bear in mind.  "], "type": ["COMMENT"]}

You can sink well over 10 million into one, depending on weaponry.

I liked the Vulture's high shields (508mj, plus a 4B cell battery), while the FAS has 340mj shields, though it can run a 5B, 4B, and 3B cell battery. \nBut how is the FAS's armor? It has roughly twice the armor as the Vulture, so is it tough enough that losing shields isn't near-instant death?\nAnd lastly, unfortunately, the FAS is quite a bit more expensive as well. Those Millitary Composite Bulkheads jump the cost from 33mil to 51mil. Is it that much of an improvement over the Vulture that it's worth the cost, or is it all subjective?"], "type": ["COMMENT"]}

Alternative missions certainly, before and after taking the pod into your cargo hold. Deliver them to Crimelords/slavers and you get wanted status perhaps, if scanned before delivery. Other bounty hunters trying to wrest the prize from your grasp, for sure. The more BHs that come after you, the more the reward for delivering the pod etc.\nPersonally I would like to see the legal salvage missions expanded into ship parts.... Imagine finding a mostly working Anaconda power distributor amongst the wreckage.... Selling that for even 50% of the price of a new one could mean millions in profits depending on the class. I suppose you would have to have a ship big enough to store them though... Using an equivalent class cargo storage rack I presume. "], "type": ["COMMENT"]}
