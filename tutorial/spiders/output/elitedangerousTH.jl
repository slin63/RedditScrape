That was followed closely by \"There has to be a better way\" and \"What should I make for lunch?\".\nI managed to come up with a few ideas that I think will go a long way to solving this problem. Also, I decided on hamburgers.\nAs it stands right now Commodities are essentially useless. They take up space, they are not worth any decent credits, some are hard to get at all and unless you are in the process of doing an engineer upgrade having them in your cargo hold is pointless. There needs to be a better way. Some of these ideas have been brought up already and forgive me for not remembering who's ideas I've shamelessly stolen here.\nStep 1: Commodity Storage\nCommodity Storage is something that the community has been asking for since they were added to the game and the devs have even stated it's something they are interested in. The dilemma is how do you balance it? Should the player have the ability to over type amass hundreds or thousands of a given commodity for a rainy day or Community Goal that needs them? The answer to that can be both yes or no depending on your viewpoint.\nMy idea is a bit of a hybrid solution. At the moment the only use for these Commodities is for Engineer upgrades. There are Material/Commodity Community Goals coming and this will address that as well.\nThe first part is that Commodities will require storage at Engineer Facilities only. If/when we get Player Build Bases/Stations then it maybe can be expanded so you can store things at \"your\" home base. Each Engineer would have their own storage area (you could even add large warehouses to the bases themselves) and any Commodities stored at that Engineers location are for use at that Engineer only. The respective Engineer is storing your Commodities for free after all so their only request is that you use those stored Commodities at their base so they can reap the benefits of it.\nWith this system it means you can only store Commodities at a given Engineer if said Engineer actually can use them. This gives a bit of an incentive to unlock that Engineer as it allows you to store Commodities there instead of either selling them or keeping them on your ship even if at the moment you don't plan to use the Engineers services.\nThere will need to be a limit of how many Commodities can be stored at an Engineer (this is per Engineer, not global). It would need to be determined if the limit is say the total amount of Commodities or a per Commodity storage limit. My idea would be 50 per Commodity per Engineer with no limit to the number of different types (so if Engineer Blueprints get added in the future with currently unused Commodities it doesn't hit a limit).\nThis means you can store 50 of a given Commodity with a given Engineer and those Commodities can only be used by that Engineer for crafting. No taking those back out and selling them or transferring them to another Engineer. This means you have to plan out what Engineers you want to use and how many Commodities you need at their location.\nTL;DR for Commodity Storage\nCommodities Stored only at Engineer Bases\nCommodities can only be used by Engineer they are stored at (no removing stored Commodities)\nEngineers will only store Commodities they can use\nLimit of 50 Commodities of a given type per Engineer\n  \nStep 2: Transferring Commodities and New Gameplay\nSo you've got some commodities in your cargo hold from missions or salvaging. What do you do with them? Do you keep them in your hold where they mysteriously send out subspace signals to every pirate in the Universe saying \"Hey, Interdict this idiot who dares have cooling hoses in his cargo hold.\"? Let's not get started on the completely broken state of NPC Interdictions in this game, that's for another thread.\nSo now you need to offload these Commodities. You currently have a couple options. You can sell them but you're only going to get peanuts for them. You could see if you have enough to craft some random bluprint from them but your in the wrong ship for that. You could jettison them into space while crying hysterically. \nWell, not anymore. The second part of my idea is to have Commodity Transfers. \nSo you pull up Space UPS/FedEx/DHL in your Contacts list at a station and you tell them \"Hey, I got 8 tons of Interdition Magnets...erm, I mean Modular Terminals that I need shipped to Elvira Martuuk right away.\" Then you pay a REASONABLE fee (note that reasonable is in capitals and bolded, hint hint) and your Commodities get shipped off for delivery to your favorite Engineer to store for your future use.\nThis would work similar to Ship and Module Transfers where it takes a bit of time for them to get there. You've now solved the problem of how to get your Commodities stored when you are 324 LY away from the Engineer.\nNow the astute among you may have noticed the \"New Gameplay\" in the Step 2 title and boy do I have some ideas for you (again, these were probably stolen from somewhere)\nSo Space UPS/FedEx/DHL haven't got teleportation yet (those        s in the escape pod industry won't reveal their secrets) so they need pilots. Open up that good old Mission Board and get hauling. These would be some nice low cargo (50 max, see Step 1) high paying missions to deliver Commodity items to Engineer bases. They'd be sorta \"faked\" obviously as you couldn't have other players actually delivering Commodities from another player but you get the point. \nNow here is the interesting part. You now have a mission to take some Commodities to an Engineer but you don't have to. Those could be your Commodities. Some of them are a right pain to get a hold of after all. You now have a choice. Do you complete the mission as requested, take your credits and boost in Faction Rep/Influence or do you decide to abandon the mission and make off with the goods yourself? Naturally you're going to take a large reputation hit and fine for not delivering your cargo to where it needed to go but that's the trade off isn't it? Some Engineers will accept stolen Commodities, some won't so you can't just take your stolen Commodities anywhere. Expand the Black Market to not only buy these stolen Commodities from you but they can fence them, giving you clean Commodities back for a price.\nThere is now another way to get hard to obtain Commodities but it has a price. Abandoning these missions would be a larger rep hit or fine than abandoning a normal mission. A balance would need to be found but the idea has merit.\nYou know those warehouses at Engineer bases I mentioned in Step 1? If you're really nuts or hate living you could try to raid one of those, steal some stored Commodities straight from an Engineer themselves. Naturally they are probably not going to like that but the chance to steal 50 Modular Terminals in one go might be enough to drive the most sane pilot to the end of their rope. The Engineer may blacklist you from working with them for a time. You'd have to weigh the costs, this could cut off a recommendation to another Engineer if you tick off the wrong Engineer.\nTL;DR for Transferring Commodities and New Gameplay\nFrom any Contacts section at Station send your Commodities to any Engineer\nShipping times/costs just like Ship/Module Transfer\nShipping is one way only (no shipping Commodities out from Engineer bases)\nCommodity Transfer Missions (Pretend you work for Space UPS/FedEx/DHL)\nAbandon Mission, make off with Commodity Cargo (Only some Engineers accept stolen Commodities)\nBlack Market accepts Stolen Commodities, will exchange for \"Clean\" Commodities for larger price.\nRaid Engineer warehouse for potential huge Commodity take but with large risk (Engineer may blacklist you)\n  \nStep 3: ???\nI'll get back to you on this one...\nStep 4: Profit\nNow that you have the ability to transfer those pesky Commodities to the Engineer of your choice, freeing up your cargo space for other things and allowing you to partake in the Engineer benefits without as much of the grind. This won't be a instant win button. You still have to contend with the RNG of the Mission Board, the Commodity drops from ships, POI locations, etc... \nWhat this aims to do is get rid of that scenario of \"OMG I just found 5 Modular Terminals but I can't use them because my Vulture is 254 LY away and has no cargo hold.\" Now you can drop those off at any station, send them to your Engineer and when you can, take the ship you want to engineer to them and go to town mashing that \"Try Again\" button when the RNG bites you in the..."], "title": ["How to Solve Commodity Storage, Add New Gameplay and Reduce Grind in One Fell Swoop"], "type": ["THREAD"]}

I really have no clue what I'm doing but I love it.\n\"Why not!?!\" I exclaimed loudly shortly before being punched in arm by my wife for startling her.\nI fumbled my way through 3 jumps to get said outpost...only overshooting the planet twice (matching my personal best!) \nNext I somehow managed my first planetary landing without becoming a flaming wreck and trembled with anticipation as I prepped my SRV for it's maiden voyage in search of the soon to be smoldering generator.\nUpon finding it I quickly came under attack by 3 sentry drones. Adrenaline took over as I nimbly maneuvered my SRV into a position equal parts upside down and wedged between two rocks. I could only watch helplessly while the drones pummeled me with bolt after bolt until I exploded.\nI came to back in my ship, now sans SRV, in orbit high above the outpost.\nI had to make the choice to limp over to the nearest station and admit defeat while sheepishly placing the order for a replacement SRV or try a potentially foolish and daring attack from the air.  I had no way of knowing if it would work or if I was heading to my inevitable end as the previously mentioned flaming wreck but I began my descent.  \nMoments later I was strafing the generator and watching with glee as sparks shot up.  Two passes later and I couldn't help but flash a giant grin as an explosion filled my screen and and the ship's computer assured that my mission was complete.\nNow I just had to make it back to base to collect my comically large payday. \nSure enough, I found myself on the receiving end of over 500 thousand credits that immediately began burning a hole in my pocket.\nThey itch was too great.  Before I knew what had happened. I found myself staring at my brand new Viper MKiV plus a few added features.\nWas it a wise purchase?  Who can say?
