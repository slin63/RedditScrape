Let's take above the 4th as an example, so the players need to both be above Competent on combat, Dealer on trading, Surveyor on explorer or Semi Professional on CQC.\nWith this, I believe we can have what a lot of people that seek better player interaction has been asking without having to worry about ruining the experience to anyone."], "title": ["A way to not ruin player experience with credit transactions.

Planned, but no timescale.\nSchematic map for use on planets coming soon\nRings will cast shadows on planet's surface, but no timescale.\nOrrery map still planned, but no timescale. Will be at back end of Season 2 if it makes it in.\nPlayer groups functionality in game. 'Yes, but...' recognising player groups as sub-factions is the start, but it won't be exactly like other game's mechanics.\nLoot/Crafting: Simple bits will be in 2.0\nTier 2 persistent NPCs: Won't be in the sense that you can kill off all NPCs in galaxy, but small additions will come sequentially. No timeframe.\nPlayed it on Vive today. 'It's awesome'. Buggies didn't make him feel sick. Getting excessively tumbled did make another player who was more prone to motion sickness feel that way.\nShark-tooth skin for the Python? Would love it, and they're looking into it, but no promises.\nAsp scout? Not military version, another variant. More like the Asp out of Frontier. Slightly more budget.\nWhen will we see significant updates to the base game? DB counters that piracy forms & bounty hunting, and new professions (mining) are significant improvements. 'It's getting better by degrees'. \nEDIT\n - Says they want to improve the use of Wings in bounty hunting and piracy, and that the story reasons for pursuing such professions will improve through Season 2.\nTurret with Hotas? You can configure as you like. Hat button etc.\nPlans to expand astronomical phenomenon? Accretion discs etc? Would love to do it. On the list. Comets are in the simulation, but getting them to look good and interact well with gameplay still need to be got right. You will be able to see medium-sized 'potato' asteroids even if you don't have Horizons.\nIs Elite an MMORPG? By almost all measures, but suggests quality / connection limits means it can still improve over time. \nDo you consider support for Force Feedback Joysticks or Wheels? Actually that would be a really good thing to do. Yes we should do it.\nDid he ever imagine in '84 Elite could look like this? Imagine yes :). Talks about under-promise, over-deliver in terms of creating impressive modern content.\nVid of buggy driving into settlement with Corvette nearby :)\nHow settlements work with single-player? Use deep ravines to approach 'under the guns' etc. The big guns don't decline etc. Only have to deal with the lighter skimmers. Could take out a generator, and both the lights and the big guns go down. Then call your ship in (if you've got all the generators). There are lots of bases, and they're varied.\nNICE! SRV being lowered out of a Cobra, internal view as you exit. Animation looks good. Drives to large base. Hexagonal heat radiators. \nPlans to reduce current transition phases? Yes, and they're constantly being worked on. (Some regions, and some connections, have excessive transitions now, and they're working on them) \nCharacter creator will be used for NPCS? Yes, and planned. But not straight away.\nKeelback? Lakon ship. You'll see in a week. Based on Type 6, but better, with more weaponry. \nHow are the DDF 'near God-like powers' re background sim coming? Straight apology on slow progress. At some point there will be something to address that, but not for now.\nBuggy too jerky in streams? Some were filmed with TrackIR, which can be less pleasurable for viewer than player, maybe the cause of concern.\nHigh end FerDeLance? Not sure where this rumour came from. Not ready to talk about that yet.\nThargoids? Well.... He was impressed by Cmdr who decoded the signals. There's more exciting stuff to come.\nWill capital ships be improved to be more fun to play with/against? Yes, there's more to come.\nAsteroid stations? You can sort of see the first vestiges them in CQC. They will come. Don't have a timeframe. Hopefully back-end of Season 2.\nMore CGs to expand the human bubble? Yes, he thinks they're wonderful. Absolutely yes.\nAre you going to play SC? Yes, looking forward to playing it.\nCan you conquer planetary bases? Can attack, but can't have your own one. Not yet anyway.\nNPCs in Horizons? NPCs driving skimmers already. NPCs driving buggies [?] unlikely in Season 2. Planetary ships, yes.\nGame API? Looking at, in pipeline.\nTransfer creds after certain rank? Suggest the cargo transfer, so not seen as a priority. Has air of exploit if done on large scale. (Says big cheaters are being banned).\nExpand 32 player cap? Could, but experience would suffer. Continually reviewing.\nJettison all cargo? Why?? You don't have to do it ;). Makes your ship lighter. And it's a surprise.\nPassengers? Planned, but can't remember exact timescale.\nCutter / Corvette? Both slightly bigger/longer than Anaconda, and have bigger hardpoints. And fit through the slot.\nWhat will you see 20k from Sol? You will see more exotic things, there will be things to find, but doesn't want to spoil\n[Missed question] - Looking at how Horizons and non-Horizons Wings perform missions together.\nPlanetary approach suite fits in every ship. SRV takes up 4t of cargo space. Doesn't take up compartment.\nMulti-sourced lighting? On the list. Might only come in High and Ultra settings. No promises.\nWill we see Cmdr faces through visors etc / when communicating? Yes face normally clear because ship pressurised.\nMore difference between stations? It's coming, not sure when. Probably not in 2.0\nVessels over Season 2? First variants will be similar to the SRV, then more down the line. Handle differently and do different things.\nShip naming? (Did we promised that? :)). He wants it. Says we will do it. I'll talk to the team tomorrow.\nSystems visited bookmarks? Doesn't know. \nModels or kits coming? Models yes, not kits that he knows of.\nPublishing the lore? Wants to. And bringing story more to fore.\nLarge cities? Ever bigger settlements coming. Big cities not in 2.0, but will come over the Season.\nSRV inside stations? Currently no, and probably not. Will look if worth doing. \nIs orbital cruise and instanced area? At the moment pretty seamless. Isn't sure on details on where the transition is. There is instancing on the surface.\nThey have rough ship layouts, but no walking etc in Season 2\nAre there \n-edit-\n \nnon-shark Thargoid species?[??]\n YES! \n[What? Who the hell asked that question? :D]\n[Mumbled] If you're in a wing should be able to share exploration data. Will look into it.\nMore CQC maps in 1.5, then more after.\nSupercruise bug? He will ask after this stream.\nThat's it :). Feel free to chip in if I fluffed any of it, I'll edit in a bit."], "title": ["Braben Q&A Summary"], "type": ["THREAD"]}
