I applied to UIUC for CS, and like a lot of people, I didn't get in. Instead, they offered me a position in DGS, and I decided to accept, thinking \"how hard could it be to get into the CS department here?\" Well, because of the restrictions on inter-collegiate transfer, it's impossible for me to transfer into the CS major before Fall 2016. Furthermore, because any college would have to see my Fall 2015 grades to accept me into their major, I wouldn't be able to get into a major before December, and that's assuming both that I get accepted, and that I get in with the standard \"wait a year in DGS to really see if you want to be in this major!\" policy waived.\nI transferred in with a ton of AP credit, to the point where I'm actually done with all of my gen eds for both the college of engineering and LAS (except for the one class that I'm taking next semester, and that I've already registered for). It's a mixed blessing, because it means that I need to take high level courses \nthat are all restricted to their respective majors\n. For CS, I need to get into 233, 241, or 210 (all of which are locked either forever or until January); at the very least, if I ignore my transfer credit, I could take 173 and 225, but those are still locked until late November. For Math, I need to take 347, or 416, or 441, all of which are locked to Math majors until December. The only classes that are useful for me to take are major-specific ones, and I can't be guaranteed a spot in any of them, let alone all of them. \nI've done my best to talk to a lot of the administration to try to get any kind of leeway or overrides, but so far everyone has been saying \"oh just wait until you transfer in fall of next year, take some gen eds in the meantime,\" and yet I can't take any classes that are unlocked for me, and that would be useful towards graduation. Is there any possible way for me to get into the classes I need before a month+ in the future? Is there anything else I could do? I'd really appreciate any help.\nTl;dr: Need to take high level classes, which are all locked to majors. I'm officially considered undecided, and it'll take longer to change that than to wait to get in those classes.

We see a LOT of leases, so we know how they've been previously applied, how they've changed through the years, and how they compare with other companies.  Generally, the shorter the lease, the more favorable it is to you... but that's not always true.  Have us look.  \nWe have records of landlord complaints over the past five years.  Just because a company is big doesn't mean 40 complaints are okay.  In 2014, there were CPM sized companies with 0 complaints.  Don't just look at the numbers, though.  We have summaries of each of the complaints, and you may view a complaint as minor/trivial.\nChampaign and Urbana have different laws governing the tenant/landlord relationship.  Chief among them, Urbana has a built in 24-hour notice requirement for landlords to inspect or show the premises.  There are a lot of other variances (square footage requirements, winterization, windows, etc).  A lot of landlords with properties in both cities write their leases for Urbana.  That's good, because on the whole, Urbana has the better tenant-focused laws, while Champaign has more stringent building codes. \nFreshmen especially, I really hope you like the 3 other people you're signing a lease with.  Once you're in a lease, it is VERY hard to be released from it.  I'm not kidding, I've only seen it happen in three circumstances:  domestic violence, military service, and building code violations.   \nShop around.  While doing so, try and make sure that the unit you sign for is the one you see.  Landlords will always make it seem like the place is about to be signed by someone else, but honestly, we have people come in in August needing a place, and they find an alright place no problem.  \nThat's all I can think of off the top of my head.  Please ask away any questions below.  I won't answer questions like \"who is better, CPM or JSM\", because companies change and I haven't dealt with them directly in the last year and a half.\nComplaints can range from \"my shower had mold in the upper right corner and the landlord couldn't get a cleaning crew out until the following Monday\" to \"my landlord had an underground meth lab and it blew up my apartment.
