Does anyone know of a pretty cheap place to go? I was planning on going this weekend for an overall hair bleaching to re-vamp my blonde, and then I normally go every 6 weeks for root touch-up. There is another school, Tricoci University in Urbana, but they're not certified and I'm not sure I would trust my hair to them. Does anyone either have a review of Tricoci, or know of a salon that does cheap bleaching? It'd be much, much appreciated!"], "title": ["Blonde looking for advice"], "type": ["THREAD"]}

After the cops left, the hall director came in to my room. I honestly have no idea what he said. I haven't received an email from the university mentioning the incident, and I'm wondering if there's any way to check if I have a strike against me or if I lucked out big time and fell through the cracks.
