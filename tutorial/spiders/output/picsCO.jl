From Wikipedia:\nThe Greenway runs south, parallel with 199th Street, and crosses a bridge over 73rd Avenue. It swings east to Francis Lewis Boulevard, crossing it on a bridge. It continues through the park, crossing the Clearview Expressway by a tunnel, and then Hollis Hills Terrace on a fourth bridge before leaving the park. There is access to 209th and 210th Streets in Hollis Hills. It goes through a wooded corridor, soon crossing over Bell Boulevard on a bridge, and provides access to 220th Street just east of Bell Boulevard. After crossing Springfield Boulevard on another bridge, there is access to Cloverdale Boulevard where the main line of BQGW goes north. The road now enters Alley Pond Park, crosses under the Grand Central Parkway, and provides access to Union Turnpike before ending at Union Turnpike and Winchester Boulevard at the park's eastern boundary.  The road survives as a continuous county road, Vanderbilt Motor Parkway (CR 67), from Half Hollow Road in Dix Hills to its original end in Ronkonkoma, just a few blocks short of the lake."], "type": ["COMMENT"]}

NFL has lots of stops and starts and involves strategy to get the ball to the endzone. Rugby is more of the ref telling the teams \"No punching, no kicking, nothing above the belt\" (Grabbing their legs so they can't run and fall over is the \"proper\" way to tackle to my knowledge) and then going to have a smoke.\nOk, there are rules and lots of them but the game doesn't pause after a tackle, instead a bunch of guys swarm the ball, trying to get possession. Compared to American Football it's a much more brutal clusterfuck (I know people say NFL hits harder but really, the worst you're usually going to get when being tackled in American Football is a concussion, Rugby can have much more severe injuries and some people hit \n as hard).\nEdit: Oh, the really big rule is you have to pass backwards(Or at best sideways). You can't just throw the ball and hope the quarterback catches it near the end-zone (Is that what happens? I don't know, my entire knowledge of American Football comes from movies and Blood Bowl 2 which isn't exactly the most accurate material)."], "type": ["COMMENT"]}

Yes, some coach busses in europe have made slight improvements in that direction, but, to my knowledge, long haul truckers in the US own their own rigs. It's a ~60k investment, according to a friend's father. At that moment, they're interested in the bottom line. My guess is that the cost to manufacture these crazy designs totally offsets any fuel savings. This is certainly true when your fuel costs are covered by a company. The only way this could work is if the trucking companies subsidizes the additional cost in order to save themselves fuel costs down the road, but it's hard to see that happening. \nYou also have to think about why we have big boxes in the first place. Sure, cost of fuel has changed, but it isn't as if the designers back then were totally unaware of aerodynamics. Modern trucks are very easy to service, that box on the front lifts up and the trucker himself can do maintenance. It doesn't look as easy with Colani's designs."], "type": ["COMMENT"]}

Reddit at its best.\nSome things you don't get from the pictures for example are: His design of the T-90 Canon Camera in the 80s influenced camera designs throughout the industry. He designed the highly functional Fiat 1100 in the 50s. The Colani Truck was actually increasing fuel efficiency by 25%. He was recognised in Europe, America, and Asia and recieved commissions on all these continents. He was a material researcher at Douglas Aircrafts, car frame designer at several major companies, designed furniture, kitchens, computer casings and other items, developed wind turbines for China, and was professor in Mexico, Germany, and China. Many of his designs became tremendously popular, some for their aesthetics and some for their practicality, and he is an economically tremendously successful designer.\nTo say \"he's unknown\" or \"he just designed impractical stuff\" is just an admission that you have no clue who you are talking about, and that you judged him purely on seeing a few selected images without context."], "type": ["COMMENT"]}
