{"url": ["http://www.thescoreesports.com/lol/news/4353"], "text": [" I think it was kind of an advantage, because... maybe they would feel the same way, but I think that we had better calls leading to mid to late game, so I think it was more of an advantage for us than them, and overall we had better late game besides the... I think when we played Darius and we had Jinx, I'm not sure if we had late, I think it was like 50-50, but we ended up giving up a few kills, then they got to mid turret and something like that, so it was really hard after giving up a few kills and a few objectives, but besides this one game I think that we had better picks and bans in the all three others.\n I think it's just because Maple is really good. Maple played in my opinion really good, he was just like running all around the map trying to get catch with LeBlanc and stuff like this, so even though we won the first game we still banned it after, because... we knew that he was the playmaker of the team, but he was just playing really really good, like doing [something] in my opinion.\n Um, I mean at this point it's mid to late game, so we were tanky enough to tank baron and don't lose too much HP, and we have a lot of damage, so we just like ok let's try to rush it, right? And I think they were on drake, so since we saw them going on drake we were like ok let's try to rush baron, in the end they didn't do drake I think, they just try to come to us at baron, and there's just a fight happening, no one focused me, and I just could... use my ultimates. That's basic... uh n00b Darius.\n**That's just how it sometimes rolls with Darius. Now in the second game you actually went up against a Malphite played by Steak and again in the mid game he landed a really good ultimate that almost sort of put the game back into the Flash Wolves' favor. What was sort of the communicatino in that fight because it looked like there was some indecision that led up to the moment where Steak landed like the three man ultimate.\n The communication... it was to go on the Malphite because he was alone, but we didn't... there's the bush, and there's the cliff just above it, and they're just behind it, but we didn't account for them to just flash in over it and Malphite going on us so we should've just get the chunk on Malphite and back off. I didn't have flash either so it was.. they were behind the wall where they could easily go on us so I don't think we should have this position at all, not [something] poorly chunk him, it was really risky. So, that's it.\n**Now earlier you said that you think your picks and bans were better. One I just wanted to specifically ask about was the Jinx pick because towards the end of the tournament more and more people were picking Jinx and seeing the power of Jinx and having a lot of success with Jinx. Now you guys left it up in the first and second game to NL who's quite a good Jinx player but in game 3 you decided to pick it away. Was there sort of a change in mindset for you to go from leaving the Jinx open to taking it away?\n Um, game 3... I can't really say for game 3 I think this is the game that we didn't really have such a good draft in my opinion, but on game 4 we went for the Jinx because we had the Lulu so it was really good, like they didn't have another tank, they had Irelia which was a bruiser but she wasn't as tanky, so Jinx could freely hit, so we just need to wait for a few items. Lulu, two or three items, Jinx, two or three items as well, then we will just roll on them.\n I don't think that anyone besides pro players or close people to teams know how well people play anyways, so I don't think Steak was bad at all, he didn't really have so many resources as well from his team, they focused a lot more on middle, especially in lane swap, tried to gank from bot side mid, stuff like this, so they are not like playing for top anyways, so it's really easy to critique top laner when the team is not really playing for top, right. So I mean, he played good overall, he had some good plays, and I think he deserved to be there.\n Um, we thought at first, we righted fast and we were like no we cannot play them. This side of SKT AHQ, I expect SKT to win pretty convincingly, uh... and us maybe facing SKT I think it's gonna be really hard. I don't, like if I need to be like truly honest I think they'll probably win against us, but we can maybe put up a fight.\n Be a better team during the early game, I think our early game is our weakest point, really, so we need to play really good early games overall."], "votes": ["571"], "type": ["COMMENT"], "hyperlink": ["https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/3ox0wl/spoiler_soaz_on_steaks_play_i_dont_think_that/cw19zgr"]}

Anti-mage for example has a blink ability(think shorter cd ezreal e), a passive ability that burns mana(featuring mana-burn damage) on auto attack and another passive that reduces spell damage taken with an ultimate that deals aoe damage based on target(point and click) missing mana. Most skillshots in dota are aoe style and straight-line skillshots are very rare. Spells also have very high mana costs and as such you will rarely use them during laning phase.\nDota also features a mechanic called denying, whereby you can essentially lasthit your own minions. This grants your lane opponent(s) reduced experience and obviously they don't get the cs gold. The combination of high mana costs and this mechanic makes for (in my opinion) a very boring lane phase of the game, with the heroes being boring to me in general.\nI vastly prefer league of legends, and one of the biggest reasons is the difference in champion design.

My argument is that China would be ahead because as a region, the coaching infrastructure in China is better than in the West. It's not defending LGD and iG's performance at worlds.\nUnless you've actually worked behind the scenes how can you possibly have any idea what the state of coaching is in China: \"\"coaching innovations\" and \"China\" in the same phrase ?  After that horrible group phase \" (your words). Just because 2 teams under perform in a single tournament does not mean that the region as a whole has a weak coaching situation and cannot innovate. It really annoys me when someone who has no knowledge of what is going on behind that scene starts to make wide generalizing statements like that without ANY knowledge at all to back it up.\nJust because iG and LGD misread the patch and couldn't adapt fast enough means that they misunderstood the patch and their opponents, it does not make their coaching staff incompetent, or the coaching staff of an entire region somehow inferior. League is a changing game, sometimes you just make the wrong call, or the metagame in which you are testing in (if you scrim with a small group of teams, you develop your own mini metagame) is just incorrect.\nWith a few exceptions, the professionalism surrounding coaching situations in the China is far ahead of most Western teams, both in terms of understanding theory and in terms of organization support for coaching across the ENTIRE LPL vs the LCS. This is partly due to money, but its also because Chinese teams have had support staff for far longer and have better experience as a region into what works and what does not.\nThere are many reasons iG and LGD performed poorly at worlds. I personally think everything you are criticising LPL teams for DOES apply to iG, but iG have had this issue all season. I don't think it applies to LGD (I think LGD prepared well but just played far below their regular level, for whatever reason, I personally blame tilt, but it could be many things, including poor preparation). Chinese teams have been innovating ALL SEASON, a lot of the strategies that we play in the LCS (from lane swaps to things like mid Chogath) were innovated first in LPL. This innovation has been happening ALL SEASON, just because they were behind at worlds means nothing (just that they failed to adapt well to this tournament and this patch).\nThis will be true even if EDG somehow lose 3-0 to FNC tomorrow.

You almost never walk into the enemy red buff while they are doing it steal it and then outplay the collapsing lanes.  That just doesn't happen at a pro level.

New Music pack for the game, Announcer Pack, New weather effects, and a comic made just for the players + another immortal item. \nIf Riot ever tried to do something similar to this, they would need to offer similar worthwhile rewards for the stretchgoals.

{"url": ["http://www.fnatic.com/content/96535/rekkles-there-is-no-favourite"], "text": ["To say that the League of Legends 2015 World Championship Group stage was full of surprises would be an understatement. Exciting matches and some major upsets were key topics in the group stages. After a rough patch during the first week, Fnatic managed to come back strong, going 3-0 on the final day and claiming the much desired first seed. This week, however, it all starts from square one with a best-of-five against one of the strongest contenders this year: China\u2019s Edward Gaming.\nAlthough EDG did not finish the LPL Summer Split in first place, they were the ones to take the win at the 2015 Mid-Season Invitational from the tournament favourites: Korea's No. 1 team SKTelecom T1. At that time, Fnatic did not look strong enough to face EDG. However, with Rekkles back on the team, the odds could turn out to be pretty even this Saturday.\nAs the fans and the eSports community eagerly wait for the best-of-five between Fnatic and EDG, I took the opportunity to talk to Rekkles who spoke about Fnatic in the group stage, his own performance, the bromance with Deft and facing EDG.\nEat, play, sleep is the routine that Fnatic have been following for the last two months. Rekkles says that this demanding investment has been taking its toll, but advancing to the quarterfinals gave him a motivational boost. \u201cThe last seven weeks have been quite hard. We have visited amazing places, and it would be nice to have done something other than just \u201ceat, play, sleep\u201c, but this even could turn out to be one of the biggest highlights of my career, and we\u2019ve invested a lot into it. I think we are on the top of our game right now. You can feel the tiredness, but the determination is also there. I think that all the teams are feeling more or less the same right now\u201c, \u2013 he shares his thoughts.\nDuring the interviews with the Fnatic team, it was repeatedly mentioned that they did not feel like themselves during the first week. I ask Rekkles what could be the possible reason for such a duality of Fnatic nature:\n\u201cI do not really know what happened during week one; we were like a different team. We weren\u2019t the Fnatic that went 18-0 in LCS Summer Split or the team that massively improved during our bootcamp in Korea. It was like we were the team who hadn\u2019t no experience playing with each other. It could have been the pressure, but I think that everything we had been through just piled up. It would have been an easy ride to go 6-0 in the group stage, but on the other hand we learned a lot from the lost games. It made us aware of some problems we didn\u2019t know existed and allowed us to solve them faster\u201d, \u2013 he says, noticing the positive side of the team\u2019s losses.\nThe fact that Fnatic still managed to get the first seed was soothing, but after the quarterfinal matches have been drawn it does not matter anymore. \u201cIn the end, there is no point system, and right now the group stage is almost forgotten. The most important thing right now is the upcoming best-of-five against EDG. We did well during the games against C9 and IG, but we were not happy about our performance against ahq. I was especially disappointed with myself; people probably saw that I could barely force myself to be cheerful about the victory. I did not perform well. I\u2019ve been sick for ten days, but this is not an excuse. I struggled to focus on the game during the match. With all this happening, I just didn\u2019t feel like a winner after all, even though we won\u201d, \u2013 Rekkles tells me sincerely.\nShow Another, Better Rekkles\nFamous for his self-criticism, Rekkles is very demanding of his own play and his part in the victory. Therefore, he grows even more serious once asked to evaluate his Worlds performance so far. Even with that near pentakill on Kennen, he says that his gameplay has been \u201cpretty bad\u201d. \u201cI am unhappy with what I have shown so far, and have been working hard since our last match to get in better shape for the EDG matchup. If every player on our team was considered to have had an equal contribution of 20 percent in the game, I don\u2018t feel like I have done enough; I haven\u2019t contributed with my 20%. I would love to chip in more. Even though we made it to the quarterfinals, I am still not satisfied. My self-criticism is my motivation, it helps me improve quicker. I know I can perform on a higher level, so hopefully fans and spectators will see another Rekkles, a better Rekkles\u201c, \u2013 his voice brightens.\nNo One Has an Upper Hand\nAlthough the Chinese teams have been struggling at Worlds so far, EDG have shown that they are a strong team. However, even they have their flaws, and their misplays were punished by SKT during the Group stage. Rekkles notes that there are no undefeatable opponents this year. \u201cThey are not the Samsung White of 2014. They showed some weak sides during the group stage matches. I wouldn\u2018t say there is a strong favourite going into our match against them. No one has an upper hand, I would rate our chances of winning equally high. At the same time, I am greatly motivated to prove myself. I am excited to play against Deft, and I believe we have  very exciting games ahead of us\u201c, \u2013 he assures. I remind Rekkles about last year\u2019s Worlds, when a Fnatic victory famously made Deft, who was then playing on Samsung Blue, cry. I ask Rekkles if there might be tears this year. \u201cI am pretty sure that depending on who comes out victorious, one of us will cry. This is after all the highlight of the whole year, and the pinnacle of our hard work. It could even be the most important point of his and my careers\u201c, \u2013 he says.\nRekkles and Deft are obviously two of the star players on their respective teams, but it is not in the botlane that you should be looking for action and excitement in the early game. \u201cI would say that the matchup to watch is YellOwStaR vs. Meiko. Both of them are famous for being roaming supports, so that can bring some interesting moments. Top lane is definitely worth paying attention to as well. In the current meta, top lane snowballs the fastest. I feel like the top lane is our strength and their weakness (note: against Fnatic, Koro1 will replace AmazingJ who played for EDG during the group stage). I guess Clearlove and ReignOver, Febiven and PawN will play the filling roles. Both PawN and Febiven proved to be very good, so it won\u2018t be easy for either side. I am looking forward to facing EDG on the Rift, and I hope we can show our best\u201c, \u2013 he smiles.\nKeeping Up Through the Distance\nOf course, one thing that the fans must be curious about is Rekkles\u2018 relationship with Deft. They not only made an interview together last year, but also posed together in London during the visit to the London Eye. Are they really buddies? Rekkles says that what he and Deft have developed is quite special. \u201cMy relationship with Deft is unique. Most people call friendship the relationship when you meet friends and do things together, but we live far away and don\u2018t see each other often. At Worlds this year, we met for the first time after last year\u2018s World Championship. We speak quite often, mostly about the game. We can talk about very in-depth in-game things that I cannot discuss with my teammates because of their lack of knowledge about the ADC role, or about particular champions that they don\u2018t play. I can\u2018t speak to other European ADCs about such things because they are basically my weekly competitors. Me and Deft talk about meta subtleties, and I think we also have similar personalities. Although we are of the same age, he reminds me of myself about two years ago: In Europe, professional players are exposed to more publicity, maturing a bit earlier. But Deft is a great player and great person\u201c, \u2013 he explains.\nRekkles called himself \u201cthe European Deft\u201d last year, and Deft still uses the ID \u201cMartin Larsson\u201d in the Korean solo queue. They have, in fact, incredibly similar playstyles. \u201cWe have quite a similar gameplay \u2013 a relatively passive lane with a focus on being strong in teamfights. I am curious to play against him because I really want to see what he is going to do. It could end up with him trying to predict my moves, but then I will also be able to predict his. I think that because of our in-game similarity, we might just end up doing nothing and farming till our teams are ready to fight. It has been quite some time since we scrimmed EDG back in Korea, and I am really excited to see what they are going to bring to the table, and if Deft is going to surprise me\u201c, \u2013 he admits.\nAre you ready for some surprises? Be there for the deciding match of who will continue their path at Worlds on Saturday, 17th of October at 3 PM CET.

But the people who are making the accusations of \"bad\" or \"good\" arent going to change when Soaz says it, cause its a lot easier to just watch 10 minutes of a game and come up with the simplest answer in your mind then to try and see that professional players are pros for a reason.\nIt also seems like league analysis is taken more seriously when it involves black and white statements... leading to the popularity of a lot of people with little knowledge and skill at the game who compensate by just making more and more claims in more and more complicated ways.\nFirst dyrus then soaz saying that some analysts really dont know what theyre talking about.

The biggest skill difference between a pro player and what it takes to analyse a pro player's skill is that the pro player has to be able to execute in real time, whereas the player analyst has time to be more considered. But the same skills would essentially make them a relatively high elo player, even if they're not Challenger, especially because League has a really low physical skill cap compared to other esports, let alone traditional sports.\nAnalysts like Monte are not particularly good at analyzing individual player skill, he's good at analyzing team strategy/macro play.

There are a lot of small things high level players do which often go unnoticed. Like in lane, the player will try to anticipate his opponent build, the way he is going to play the lane, what his goals will be and he will adapt his play to that. The player will also adapt his plan according to what happens on the rest of the map (TP, jungle movements, roams, etc.). In the end this may result in an all-in fight, a solo-kill, a dive, which is what most viewers will base their judgement on, but what really matters is what lead to that play, unless there are huge mechanical misplays.  However, you can't even see that in proplay most of the time, since the camera never focuses on a single lane constantly, which makes it pretty much impossible to accurately judge the laning skill of a player by something else than the end result. Sometimes it gives an accurate picture of the skill of the player, sometimes it doesn't. \nSo it's obvious that a proplayer will be able to judge that stuff better, he just has more information than the viewer."], "votes": ["2"], "type": ["COMMENT"], "hyperlink": ["https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/3ox0wl/spoiler_soaz_on_steaks_play_i_dont_think_that/cw1mp4k"]}

If only laning was as simple as X hero vs Y hero then Z action must be taken, but this is not the case. There are many more factors that need to be taken into consideration many of which we are unable to see during a competitive game due to the spectator cam moving all over the place.

{"url": ["http://www.thescoreesports.com/lol/news/4353"], "text": [" I think it was kind of an advantage, because... maybe they would feel the same way, but I think that we had better calls leading to mid to late game, so I think it was more of an advantage for us than them, and overall we had better late game besides the... I think when we played Darius and we had Jinx, I'm not sure if we had late, I think it was like 50-50, but we ended up giving up a few kills, then they got to mid turret and something like that, so it was really hard after giving up a few kills and a few objectives, but besides this one game I think that we had better picks and bans in the all three others.\n I think it's just because Maple is really good. Maple played in my opinion really good, he was just like running all around the map trying to get catch with LeBlanc and stuff like this, so even though we won the first game we still banned it after, because... we knew that he was the playmaker of the team, but he was just playing really really good, like doing [something] in my opinion.\n Um, I mean at this point it's mid to late game, so we were tanky enough to tank baron and don't lose too much HP, and we have a lot of damage, so we just like ok let's try to rush it, right? And I think they were on drake, so since we saw them going on drake we were like ok let's try to rush baron, in the end they didn't do drake I think, they just try to come to us at baron, and there's just a fight happening, no one focused me, and I just could... use my ultimates. That's basic... uh n00b Darius.\n**That's just how it sometimes rolls with Darius. Now in the second game you actually went up against a Malphite played by Steak and again in the mid game he landed a really good ultimate that almost sort of put the game back into the Flash Wolves' favor. What was sort of the communicatino in that fight because it looked like there was some indecision that led up to the moment where Steak landed like the three man ultimate.\n The communication... it was to go on the Malphite because he was alone, but we didn't... there's the bush, and there's the cliff just above it, and they're just behind it, but we didn't account for them to just flash in over it and Malphite going on us so we should've just get the chunk on Malphite and back off. I didn't have flash either so it was.. they were behind the wall where they could easily go on us so I don't think we should have this position at all, not [something] poorly chunk him, it was really risky. So, that's it.\n**Now earlier you said that you think your picks and bans were better. One I just wanted to specifically ask about was the Jinx pick because towards the end of the tournament more and more people were picking Jinx and seeing the power of Jinx and having a lot of success with Jinx. Now you guys left it up in the first and second game to NL who's quite a good Jinx player but in game 3 you decided to pick it away. Was there sort of a change in mindset for you to go from leaving the Jinx open to taking it away?\n Um, game 3... I can't really say for game 3 I think this is the game that we didn't really have such a good draft in my opinion, but on game 4 we went for the Jinx because we had the Lulu so it was really good, like they didn't have another tank, they had Irelia which was a bruiser but she wasn't as tanky, so Jinx could freely hit, so we just need to wait for a few items. Lulu, two or three items, Jinx, two or three items as well, then we will just roll on them.\n I don't think that anyone besides pro players or close people to teams know how well people play anyways, so I don't think Steak was bad at all, he didn't really have so many resources as well from his team, they focused a lot more on middle, especially in lane swap, tried to gank from bot side mid, stuff like this, so they are not like playing for top anyways, so it's really easy to critique top laner when the team is not really playing for top, right. So I mean, he played good overall, he had some good plays, and I think he deserved to be there.\n Um, we thought at first, we righted fast and we were like no we cannot play them. This side of SKT AHQ, I expect SKT to win pretty convincingly, uh... and us maybe facing SKT I think it's gonna be really hard. I don't, like if I need to be like truly honest I think they'll probably win against us, but we can maybe put up a fight.\n Be a better team during the early game, I think our early game is our weakest point, really, so we need to play really good early games overall."], "votes": ["573"], "type": ["COMMENT"], "hyperlink": ["https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/3ox0wl/spoiler_soaz_on_steaks_play_i_dont_think_that/cw19zgr"]}

That being said , i dunno who could replace huni in top , but considering that players like cabochard apeared out of nowhere , i think fnc would have found an adequate toplaner as well. Now ofc , we don't know if that team would have glued as well as this one did , since both huni and RO are young , hungry for success and willing to learn english/improve , but honestly speaking , EU as a region always created their own talents , and promoted them as well.

This is the world championships, its unacceptable not to have watched LCS games and understand how to play against Western early game teams (as well as knowing how to play around things like support Shen and assuming its top lane when its not a huni style champion).\nSo basically you have 2 Chinese teams underperforming, one due to tilt (understandable), one due to complacency (not really understandable). This DOES NOT mean that the region as a whole cannot innovate coaching, or that the region as a whole is tilting/complacent just because 1-2 teams are. This is only one tournament, and a very small sample size on one patch. Its a criticism of LGD and iG the teams, not China the region."], "votes": [], "type": ["COMMENT"], "hyperlink": ["https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/3ozl19/discussion_how_strong_do_you_think_each_region/cw21mhc"]}

I've yet to see any succesfull inovation comming from a CN team. The lack of understanding vs western lane swaps or the inability to deal with some weird  picks (morde , veigar , anivia , etc) also shows adapting problems. Adaptation and preparation for pick and bans are coaching staff related issues. I'm not saying that CN isn't good. What i'm pointing out is that they haven't showed any of the qualities you speak of yet.

My argument is that China would be ahead because as a region, the coaching infrastructure in China is better than in the West. It's not defending LGD and iG's performance at worlds.\nUnless you've actually worked behind the scenes how can you possibly have any idea what the state of coaching is in China: \"\"coaching innovations\" and \"China\" in the same phrase ?  After that horrible group phase \" (your words). Just because 2 teams under perform in a single tournament does not mean that the region as a whole has a weak coaching situation and cannot innovate. It really annoys me when someone who has no knowledge of what is going on behind that scene starts to make wide generalizing statements like that without ANY knowledge at all to back it up.\nJust because iG and LGD misread the patch and couldn't adapt fast enough means that they misunderstood the patch and their opponents, it does not make their coaching staff incompetent, or the coaching staff of an entire region somehow inferior. League is a changing game, sometimes you just make the wrong call, or the metagame in which you are testing in (if you scrim with a small group of teams, you develop your own mini metagame) is just incorrect.\nWith a few exceptions, the professionalism surrounding coaching situations in the China is far ahead of most Western teams, both in terms of understanding theory and in terms of organization support for coaching across the ENTIRE LPL vs the LCS. This is partly due to money, but its also because Chinese teams have had support staff for far longer and have better experience as a region into what works and what does not.\nThere are many reasons iG and LGD performed poorly at worlds. I personally think everything you are criticising LPL teams for DOES apply to iG, but iG have had this issue all season. I don't think it applies to LGD (I think LGD prepared well but just played far below their regular level, for whatever reason, I personally blame tilt, but it could be many things, including poor preparation). Chinese teams have been innovating ALL SEASON, a lot of the strategies that we play in the LCS (from lane swaps to things like mid Chogath) were innovated first in LPL. This innovation has been happening ALL SEASON, just because they were behind at worlds means nothing (just that they failed to adapt well to this tournament and this patch).\nThis will be true even if EDG somehow lose 3-0 to FNC tomorrow.

Anti-mage for example has a blink ability(think shorter cd ezreal e), a passive ability that burns mana(featuring mana-burn damage) on auto attack and another passive that reduces spell damage taken with an ultimate that deals aoe damage based on target(point and click) missing mana. Most skillshots in dota are aoe style and straight-line skillshots are very rare. Spells also have very high mana costs and as such you will rarely use them during laning phase.\nDota also features a mechanic called denying, whereby you can essentially lasthit your own minions. This grants your lane opponent(s) reduced experience and obviously they don't get the cs gold. The combination of high mana costs and this mechanic makes for (in my opinion) a very boring lane phase of the game, with the heroes being boring to me in general.\nI vastly prefer league of legends, and one of the biggest reasons is the difference in champion design.
