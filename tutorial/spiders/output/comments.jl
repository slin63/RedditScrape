{"url": ["https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/3p4rvj/what_was_your_most_epic_fuck_up_with_a_girl/"], "text": ["In High School there was this one girl that sat next to me in my Spanish class. I struggled through the class primarily because I wasn't interested, and this girl happened to be really good at it. She would often help me with my classwork and strike up conversation, which to me seemed pretty normal. Eventually she became flirty and I thought nothing of it. I had just lost 70 pounds and was getting used to my body, plus I had never flirted with anyone before that point so I was clueless to pick up on cues.\nWell as the semester progressed she became more friendly, and started to talk to me in other classes we had together. I was still clueless at the time to what any of that meant, but here's where it gets really sad. We had a project that we had to do for our cooking class and when we went to the library to do research, naturally, she sat next to me. While I was trying to get work done she began a conversation with me and the guy sitting near us. Well me and the guy started talking about history, and since I love history I began talking incredibly passionately about it. While I am talking she tries to get involved and starts asking questions, to which I answer confidently. That must of been a turn on for her (my confidence) because she began biting her lip and stroking her leg. I got nervous and ignored it all. \nBut the worst fuck up of this situation was when the final exam was coming up. I was panicking about taking it, considering I wasn't great in that class. So I start asking a friend some questions about what will be on the exam, yadda yadda, and she comes over and says she can help. I told her I appreciated that but it was alright. She then told me that she would love to come over to my house to help me study, to which my dumbass responded with \"That's okay, my mom speaks fluent Spanish, I can ask her for help.\" After that she slowly stopped talking to me.

We\u2019d been talking for a few months about finding an escape from the daily reality of commuting, sitting in an office, and dealing with troves of Bostonians. Those of you who live here probably hate the T almost as much as I do, especially the green line, that twisted, rusted weed that calls itself a train. As a recent college grad, I\u2019m not sure I\u2019ll be able to handle the real world forever.\nAnyway, suffice it to say we were all ready to jump full-tilt into two weeks of nature and distance from the general populace. Jordan, who can almost be described as your quintessential \u2018IT guy,\u2019 had done some Google searches one day and learned about a place in Canada called Woodland Caribou Provincial Park. \u201cI mean, it\u2019s got pretty much everything we\u2019re looking for,\u201d he started saying, \u201clike canoeing and camping and forest trails. And supposedly, there\u2019re very few people who actually make it there--\u201d\nMy other friend, Chrissy, interrupted him almost immediately. \u201cSold. I\u2019m marking it in my calendar now.\u201d I\u2019ve known Chrissy since sophomore year in college. When I met her, honestly, she was so striking all I could think about was trying to \u2018mack,\u2019 but after a few years of learning about each other's\u2019 numerous and bizarre intricacies, all three of us are about as platonic as you can get.\nSorry for the tangents. It\u2019s easy to get caught up in all the little details when I start writing. Fast forward to the third night of our trip, when the three of us were drinking Heinekens (disclaimer: we kept all the cans and stuck as close as we possibly could to the \u2018leave no trace\u2019 policy) next to a fire that had reduced itself to a mound of glowing coals. It was throwing off an incredible amount of heat, so we were actually quite warm even in the subfreezing temperature, but the lack of flames kept the visibility to the river pretty high.\nChrissy was in the middle of telling us about this guy from work who had evolved a habit of clumsy flirtation when we all heard a distinct \n come from the direction of the river. Moonlight glinted on its surface, barely visible through the screen of trees, but the noise was loud. Clear.\nThere was no movie-moment where someone said, \u201cDid you hear that?\u201d Just silence. Chrissy stopped in the middle of her story and the three of us cocked our heads, looking toward the river. Again. \n\u201cI didn\u2019t think there were supposed to be other people here,\u201d Jordan hissed at me, as if \n had some control over other campers being near us. I just shrugged and rolled my eyes.\nAnd then without warning the brush on our right exploded and snow scattered across our fire like a careless plow had just driven by. The coals hissed and some went dark. Chrissy screamed and Jordan yelled \u201cWhat the \n!\u201d which shattered our previously courteous presence.\nSome \n, an enormous black shape no more than a silhouette in the light of the half-dead coals, tore through our campsite with little heed to us.I thought I caught a glimpse of antlers and a cadaverous, sunken chest, but I could be wrong. When already-dim light suddenly changes, it\u2019s nearly impossible to see right for a few seconds.\nNone of us were killed. None of us were attacked. At least directly. But drunk as we were, I know for a fact that we didn\u2019t imagine the event that night. We ended up taking watches until morning (it was too cold and potentially dangerous to make the trek back to our car), and the morning light revealed twisted footprints leading off into the wilderness. Do I wish we had tracked the thing? A little bit. Am I relieved we didn\u2019t? A little bit. But one day, maybe I\u2019ll return to Woodland Caribou Provincial Park. If any of you have camped there, have you seen anything odd?\n Wendigos are real."], "votes": ["3"], "type": ["COMMENT"], "hyperlink": ["https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/3p4fiy/what_mythicalparanormal_being_ie_ghosts_bigfoot/cw36g8u"]}

I, and the people that I do this with, are paranoid to hell about it. TBH I really shouldn't be alluding to it here, but I'm pissed and in the mood to talk about it a bit.\nOne thing that I'm really proud of publicly.\nThere's a powerstation in the UK called Didcot. Greenpeace (who I fucking hate, they keep on burning sites for us) had scaled the chimney a couple of times as the fence was chainlink, and really piss poor. So the power station erected a 5 metre high electric fence to keep them out, with sensors to set an alarm if anyone messed with it. So when it closed, and we wanted to get in, 2 of us went for a wander round the perimeter. \nThere were 4 ways in. \nThe 4th way, I'm really pissed that we've never had to do this, as it was going to be so epic, that i doubt anyone would believe that we'd done it.\nIn the uk, power pylons have a cable that connects them, it connects to the very pinacle of the pylon. Now, climbing pylons is a stupid thing to do, but I'm really stupid. \nPeople think that the top cable is live, but it's not. It serves a dual purpose, it's an earth, and it's also the backbone of the UKs internet.\nMy plan was to climb the pylon, stick a pulley on the top cable, tyrolean across it, then climb down the pylon on the inside. \nI got as far as testing it on pylons near where I live, climbing to the top, sitting on top of the pylon with the cable between my legs, then hanging off it to see if it would take my weight (it did if you're still reading).

Botox saved my sanity.\nI find the treatment itself painful- here's my experience:\nOne appointment to find various pressure points/point of pain origin associated with different nerve endings and blood vessels. For about an hour, the neurologist hooked me up to some sort of monitor and poked, prodded, squeezed and pinched various areas around my shoulders, neck and skull. He marked those areas on a computer diagram.\nWith each visit, he would inject the Botox into those areas (deeper than cosmetic Botox I have been told)- my first visit was over 25 spots. As time continued, he would ask me where it helped, different areas of my brain that the migraines would start and spread to, etc.\nThere are three months between visits. The first visit was good. Second was not terrible. Third one? PASSED OUT COLD on the floor after he hit a \"sweet spot.\" Dude. I hate needles, and was putting on the brave face until then.\nBut then... with each visit, each new area (subtracting a quite a few too), my migraine days decreased and the episodes become quite tolerable. I can actually go to work (I'm a high school Graphic Design teacher) and just rock some sunglasses on those days and stay at work with my 120+ teenagers for 8 hours. I don't go running to the bathroom to dry heave or crawl under my desk in a dark classroom during my prep period. \nIt works great for me- I'm happy. I know of others it's not worth it, or it doesn't work as much as it does for me.

The ground knowledge events had subject such as complex aviation math problems or one about finding errors during a preflight inspection.\nMy main event thought was called aircraft recognition.

I'll admit that it isn't a bad thought, and if you decided to build an inexpensive system to do so, I would buy it. I was so impressed by the thought that I decided to do the math. The average American family of 4 uses 160 gallons of water a day to shower and use the sink. The family uses 100 gallons a day for the toilet. You'd pay $0.002 per gallon in California, the drought state. In California a family of 4 pays $0.20 a day for toilets- $76.00 a year.\nYou'd have to have a tank that holds around 160 gallons of water, a method of incorporating it to a house's plumbing and septic pumps. Using the lowest price of installation for a septic system and 150 gallon septic tank, it should cost around $2000.00. This is a ludicrous amount of money to spend for an annual $70.00 savings on your water bill. It would take 30 years for the investment to be worth it. \nHowever, if you could find a way to simplify installation to the point that it would not require professional help, it'd only cost around $350.00. This would make it a good 5 year investment for homeowners. If you had a financing plan of $70.00 a year for 5 years, a customer would not even suffer any temporary financial setback.\nTo market it, you'd want to appeal to these 3 groups\n-homeowners\n-ecoterrorist\n-the housing market(environmentally friendly houses have a higher value on the market).\nConsidering this is just a tank and a pump attached to a shower drain, a simple prototype should be easy to make. The problem you will face is making it simple for people to install. That requires information on housing structure, plumbing, septic tanks, and the mathematics of pressure. You can gain information about house building by volunteering for Habits for Humanity. You can learn about plumbing through youtube videos and by tinkering with your home's plumbing. You can learn about septic tanks by buying one in a junkyard. You can learn about pressure science(ideal gas law, viscosity, Pascals) by using wikipedia, Khan Academy, and by asking your local community college physics professor for a favor.\nFor early stage designs use Blender( a free design software ) and styrofoam, pipe cleaners, aluminum foil, paper mache, balloons, clay, 3d printers, and molten sugar.\nHope this has helped."], "votes": ["11"], "type": ["COMMENT"], "hyperlink": ["https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/3p3uyq/reddit_what_still_seems_primitive_considering_our/cw32xjx"]}

My life is my life and might not fit what others would consider as \"great.\" But, it is what I want and I'm happy with, on the majority. Sure, it takes fine tuning and direction changes still, but that's life. \nThe point of me saying any of this is because I felt the way you seem like you do and like the quote talks about until I realized that what was holding me back was me all along. Until I realized that, I was chasing external reasons/goals that I thought would magically make me happy. \nI can say, in most cases, the external \"milestones\" aren't what does it; it's the internal dialogue. Until you figure out what it is that you want out of life and begin taking the serious, and sometimes risky, steps to make those things happen, you're just chasing phantoms. \nSorry if this is rambling; it's late and I'm tired. I just wanted to respond because it struck a chord. \nGood luck!!!"], "votes": ["29"], "type": ["COMMENT"], "hyperlink": ["https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/3p0sl2/redditors_that_have_mastered_the_art_of_small/cw2s29u"]}

These swords, as was mentioned above, made their debut under the use of landsknecht. So the reason we switch to calling it that is to try to represent a more accurate picture of just what sword we're talking about.\nThere is also the \n which I think tended to be a little shorter than the zweihander (these can usually be identified by the acorns on the ends of the quillons and the ring guards sticking perpendicular to the main quillons), and the \n which is also known by the more common name claymore, these are even shorter than the other greatswords, but are still somewhat longer and heavier than your typical longsword (these in my experience typically have the three-ring pattern coming of the quillons, thought that might just be a theme seen in replicas)."], "votes": ["189"], "type": ["COMMENT"], "hyperlink": ["https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/3p3u4f/what_is_the_biggest_doubleedged_sword/cw2xsv9"]}

We planned to go to prom together after I had asked her by performing a Fresh Prince of Bel-Aire parody song. \nShe joined my circle of friends and was very affable with all of them. About a week before prom I became suspicious that she only started dating me to get close to a buddy of mine because they were always texting whenever we'd be on a date among other minor things.\nI confronted her right after a class we had together and straight-up told her that we were done and to find another prom date. I unleashed a tirade about how shitty it was that she'd use me just to get close to my friend and fuck him. She was so pissed she ran off without saying a word.\nThat night when I was hanging with my friends, the friend she was getting close to was furious with me about dumping her right before prom and why the fuck I did it. I told him she was a bitch who only wanted to fuck him.\nHe enlightened me with the knowledge that they were actually planning a kick-ass after-prom party that was being funded with a portion of the limo money, and that the girl I was dating had an open house on prom night. \nThey were going to surprise us all with booze, weed, etc., and I probably would have lost my virginity that night.\nI got to go to prom with a chick with big tits but she wouldn't fuck me and I didn't lose my virginity till college. \nTLDR: I could've had a great prom night and relationship with this girl that would've lasted a long time, and I fucked it up.\nEdit: typos"], "votes": [], "type": ["COMMENT"], "hyperlink": ["https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/3p4rvj/what_was_your_most_epic_fuck_up_with_a_girl/cw3ag5m"]}

Let's call her \"S\" or as I referred to as \"hot neighbour\". \"S\" lived on the floor beneath me and we would casually see each other in the building gym or outside common area, share elevator rides, and so on. Other than being struck by her looks, we never shared words. (I typically date shorter blondes and \"S\" was taller with black hair)\nI was already casually involved with 3 other woman (one being my current girlfriend) and chasing a crush in my building posed more potential harm than good. So I left the fantasy girl alone assuming she wouldn't be interested anyways. (sour grapes I know but I'm an idiot sometimes)\nFast forward 2 months, and I'm a local bar, kind of tipsy, and this beautiful girl is enthusiastically waving at me from across the bar. It \"S\", she's also drunk but she made the first move and we introduce ourselves and chit chat. After an hour of shots and iirc charming conversation \"S\" ask \"If I wanted to walk home with her?\" I agree and we leave. Get in to my elevator start making out like horny teenagers. She's great kisser too. She stops at her door and says \"that's all for tonight\" all bubbly and cute and we part ways. (With all the one night stands I've had I respect the shit out of girls that won't sleep with me after first meeting.) Points \"hot neighbour\"\nNext day I'm smitten, track her down on social media, PM her for bit send her my number and let the texting begin! The following week I ask her on date. She declines because she's working but says she'll come over to my place for a quick drink an hour before work. She comes over, I pour us each a bourbon (she loves bourbon BONUS), and we talk. I'm enthralled with this woman from looks to her taste, to her personality. I reveal my schoolboy crush, \"S\" reveals that she had also been scoping me out as well. Things are great! She leaves and I go out for the evening. Later at home I wake up to phone call 4am from \"S\" asking \"if I was still up, and wanted to hang out?\" HELL YES! She comes over, we have drink, start kissing than retire to my room. Without getting into the details the sex was AMAZING! I'm almost certain the best I've had. We do it till sun was coming up, literally. I'm beginning to fall for this one.\nThe next 3 months were very much slight variations of that night. Our time spent together good, simple, pure fun. I started noticing her getting picked up in front the building (Obviously on other dates but who am I to judge because I was seeing 3 other girls.) I like her a lot, but my ego and fear stop me from pursuing her further. Things start to fizzle. I don't want them to but I assume she was losing interest in me or lack of progress in our circumstances, our time was ending. Based on that assumption I enter into a committed relationship with my current GF after one last wild night of passion with \"S\".\nFast forward 5 months, of practically zero contact with \"S\" I run into her at a club opening. We pick up conversation like old friends, talk about everything including our current relationships. I voice how much I miss her and like her, she reciprocates. Says things like \"If things ever go south with my SO, I'm coming after you.\" and \"We should get together once month and fuck ah err..have dinner.\" I laugh and shrug but want to tell her it was my biggest regret not going all in for her tell her my true feelings of falling for her. \nPart of me feels she better off with someone who did what i couldn't, who treat her better, who financially can shower her with the things she deserves. Also I have a GF who I adore and it's a silly \"what could have been?\" The other thinks I let \"the one\" slip away and I've got to get her back. These feelings aren't lost on her either I believe because we've ran into each other twice since that night and topic of conversation is always of how much we miss seeing each other.\nPersonally I can't think of more epic cliche fuck up in my life."], "votes": [], "type": ["COMMENT"], "hyperlink": ["https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/3p4rvj/what_was_your_most_epic_fuck_up_with_a_girl/cw3aq09"]}

At this point, I have been wrestling for 13 years, but I never got used to a difficult weigh-in. I was cutting a major amount of weight and the next day was weigh-ins. I was sitting in class thinking about that epic first meal and what I should make. Having taken a short inventory of my house, I found that what my mom had in stock wouldn't suffice. I texted her and asked if she could leave her credit card on the table before she went out with her friends so I can get some groceries. I didn't think of anything but food all day. I got home, ran to the counter, grabbed the credit card and headed out the door. I was brushing through the aisles at safeway with an empty stomach and money i wasnt responsible for. I came home and made 30 PB&J's, a basket of bananas, oranges, and two quarts of apple juice. \nI came out of weigh-ins after barely making weight but my newly bought cooler was as full as my pride as I flaunted to my teammates the epic feast that followed. I was done eating somewhere around an hour after I started but it was all gone. I proceeded to the mat to start warming up and my stomach felt a little strange. I brushed it off and went to the stands to hang out with some friends (but mostly to flirt with the cute girl who recorded stats for the team). \nI get down to the mat feeling bloated and somewhat uneasy. I was ranked number one and this kid was no more of a challenge than one of those PB&J's. \nIt was going great; I would take a shot, get my 3 points nearfall then let him up to do it again. I was on my third cycle when my stomach seemed to implode and I was on my knees after attempting a shot. He sprawled flat, and I tried to shake it off, but I couldn't. I don't remember what happened, but I ended up on my back (debilitated by my stomach) and was bridging for my life. the cute girl was on my mat and and we met eye contact as I tried to make a saving escape. I was bridging for my life when all of the sudden, all let loose.\nFecal matter passed like coffee through a filter and my feet slipped beneath my butt. I shit everywhere. It was everywhere. my borrowed singlet was tarnished, the eyebrows of the referee were dusted, and my opponent used by frontside as a shield.\nI escaped and ran to the bathroom immediately. I waitde for someone to come in so I can use a phone to call my mom to bring new underwear.\nThe cutie and I never spoke again.\nI was called \"the shit kid\" by every school in the county for the rest of my high school career (and afterward, people post on my page asking if I remember. Yes, I remember. If you do, so do I.)"], "votes": [], "type": ["COMMENT"], "hyperlink": ["https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/3p4rvj/what_was_your_most_epic_fuck_up_with_a_girl/cw3aqux"]}

My FIL started up his own engineering firm and through sheer hard work and good management made it into something he was proud of.\nAnyway, he used to take my husband (his son) with him on weekends/school holidays/after school etc to ground him in the business so that he learnt some valuable skills, but essentially started at the bottom.  He got no extra privileges, the older guys on the team had seniority so my husband often got the worst jobs.\nSo, my husband, now 16 or thereabouts, comes home stumbling drunk in the early hours of the morning, forgetting that he has work with his dad the next day and that they leave at 05:30.  He is so sick he spends some time retching violently into the toilet then collapses into bed.  His dad pulls his out of bed and says - 'get ready for work.  Work doesn't wait.'  Just as a side note, my FIL was no angel, and was a real party animal.  When it was work though, no matter how crap you feel, you give 100%.  No excuses.  \nSo, husband rinses his mouth, and stumbles out of the door after his dad wearing last night's clothes.  Even that early it was a burning hot day.  My FIL decides that this is the time to take the back (dirt) roads to the job site (a new warehouse being built).  Very bumpy road.  Slow down to a crawl so that you can feel every bump in the road, then speed up and ramp over the big bumps so that your stomach drops.  My husband still gets a bit green around the gills when he remembers it.  My FIL (LOL) was very solicitous and kept saying stuff like - 'Oh, I am sorry, are we feeling a bit fragile today?'  Speed up, WHOOMP.  Then he takes a warm beer from yesterday out of the cooler box, cracks it and waves it under my hubby's nose, cue my husband gagging.\nWhen they finally made it to the warehouse my FIL made him paint a yellow line that demarcated a huge portion of the warehouse for safety reasons.  No (whatever) past this point or something.  All he said was, I don't want one drop of yellow paint outside of that line.  If you have to stay here for days, you'll do it.  So, here's my poor husband, enveloped in paint and thinner fumes, hands shaking, trying not to paint free hand outside of this line that was probably half the warehouse's length.  He kept having to run and puke from the paint fumes now and again, but he got the job done, and his dad was a perfectionist.\nAfterwards his dad took him out for a greasy meal, they smoked a joint together, and he never drank to that extent before working with his dad again.  My hubby always says about that day - 'I just wanted to die.  Fuck I miss my dad.'

The book and the movie were made at the same time so really the book ending is just one of many interpretations of the movie, it's not a direct adaptation.\nTheir was an alien civilization that evolved first in our galaxy - in all their search they found no other advanced life, so they resolved to encourage it. In their efforts, they built the Monoliths, advanced supercomputers capable of independently operating and encouraging the evolution of life. Their efforts are not flawless, and they must often choose one species over another to give them a chance (it's implied they caused the impact which ended the reign of reptiles on our planet). When the apes encountered the monolith, it took over their minds for a moment, testing the abilities and manipulating them to test their physical and mental potential. It imparted the idea of using tools on them, and then withdrew. This allowed the apes to \"conquer\" the water hole and have more resources.\nMuch later, humans discover a second monolith on the moon. This one is there as a test and a marker, as once it is discovered it signals its superior near Jupiter that humanity has advanced to early space travel. \nAt the end, Dave approaches the monolith. It opens into a Stargate and pulls him inside. He is taken through a few 'hubs' and sees many alien ships using this transit system. Afterwards he is taken to the hotel room. This room is a recreation by the aliens to make him comfortable, right down to cereal boxes in the pantry and a bible in the desk drawer. Dave sees that none of these are real, they are just solid objects. He goes to sleep, and while he sleeps the aliens free his mind from his body, making him somewhat like a ghost (not too different from Dr. Manhatten in some ways), essentially once again evolving man to the next step.\nI highly recommend the books, as well as anything else by Clarke, especially Chikdhood's End and Rendezvous with Rama "], "votes": ["21"], "type": ["COMMENT"], "hyperlink": ["https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/3p3s0m/what_unexplained_part_of_a_movie_have_you_always/cw31odq"]}

They're my favorites because they're the ones I get to play most often. If I can find the right group, \n, \n and \n.\nEdit: Let me expand on some of these, and add a few more:\n: Each player plays a monster (big lizard, big ape, big alien) terrorizing the city of Tokyo. Players try, yahtzee-style, to balance earning credits, causing descrution, buying abilities, and healing. The catch is that only one player is in Tokyo at any given time, and while they are there they score points. Those out of Tokyo can only hurt the player in Tokyo, but the player in Tokyo hurts all other players. However, you cannot heal while in Tokyo, so at some point you have to give it up and let someone else terrorize for a while.\n: A fully cooperative game where all players are trying to cure four diseases that are ravaging the world. Players must balance stopping the spread of disease--if a disease outbreaks too often or gets too big, the game ends in a loss--with also collecting cards needed for a cure. An \n tense game that sets up some pretty awesome chain reactions, I've never really had this game go bad.\n: Each player plays a race of mythical creatures (Orcs, Rat-men, Giants, etc) combined with a special ability, and try to take over as many territories on a map as they can, Risk-style. The gimmick here is that each race is matched with a random ability, so one game might have Flying Skeletons and the next game might be Underwater Skeletons. There's a nifty self-balancing mechanic that prevents a combo from getting too powerful.\n: An older game from the 70s based off of the classic novel by Frank Herbert. It's almost impossible to find today, but is widely regarded as a top-tier game from the era. Six factions (Atreides, Harkonnen, the Guild, the Fremen, the Emperor, and the Bene Gesserit) each with their own extensive special abilities, try to control Dune. Unlike most wargames, the battles were almost completely random-free, and the game was thematic almost to a fault. \n: Hard to find nowadays, but it's a political game representing the election in 1960 between Nixon and Kennedy. Not for everyone but I like it.\n: A semi-cooperative game of people trying to survive a zombie outbreak. It's mostly cooperative, but each player has their own personal goal--and if that goal isn't met, you don't win at the end with everyone else. With a few clever mechanics and dripping with theme, it's one of the more recent blockbusters.\nTwilight Struggle: Currently one of the top-ranked games of all time, this is a game portraying the Cold War. One player plays as the Soviets, and the other the US. Players try and influence the various nations of the world to align with them. The main gimmick is that the deck of cards all represent real historical events (Cuban Missile Crisis, founding of NATO, US-Japan Treaty, etc), but either player can get cards from either side. So a US player might get a card that benefits the Soviets, and they \n--but they at least can time the event right so the benefits are limited. It's top-ranked for a reason, but it is a \n long game (3 hours is roughly the norm, maybe 2 if you rush, but 5-hour games aren't unheard of) and not one you want to start off with.\n is a classic game, where a relatively simple set of rules (aliens trying to take over different planets) is pushed up against special abilities. Each alien breaks the rules in some manner (for example, normally a player with a higher strength would win a battle...except for one player, where if you fight him the lowest strength wins.) Since the game relies on negotiation for a large part if it, it's an amazing self-balancing experience.\n: You remember Werewolf or Mafia, where everyone has a hidden role and players are trying to guess who it is? There's a whole line of games that play off this concept The Resistance is one of the more popular version of this. \n is a game where there are several factions--like Pirates, Wizards, or Dinosaurs--and each player gets dealt two of these factions. They then use the special cards and abilities of those two factions to control bases and win the game. So for one game you'd play as Pirate Wizards, and the next game Robot Pirates.\n: I added this above, because it's by far one of the most popular modern games out there. It plays a lot like rummy where you collect cards of the same color (suit), but when you do make a meld you use it to lay track in a railroad on the board. You are trying to connect two cities based on secret cards you draw.\n is a deck-building game, were as the game progresses your personal hand of cards grows and includes more cards to help you. It literally created an entire new genre of games, and is still fun today.

Put simply, it's the study of what comes after the Industrial Age and which is lacking in a more specific term as we are still unsure of its definitive paradigms. It's what Alvin Toffler referred to as the 'Third Wave' of civilization after the Agrarian and Industrial ages. Once more commonly used, the term was misappropriated by late 20th century economists to describe countries that have outsourced their industry to the developing world. Today it's commonly referred to by a collection of terms usually referring to its individual facets such as 'post-scarcity', 'post-capitalist', and so on but I prefer the original term as more comprehensive. \nThe core premise of Post-Industrial futurism is that the paradigms that define the Industrial Age--chiefly, the concepts of capitalism, corporation, centralized mass production, zero-sum economics, and the Westphalian state--are being eroded by the evolution of the technologies upon which they depend--chiefly, production automation, information, and communications technology--and the accumulation of their social and environmental impact resulting in eventual economic and political disruption or collapse. Key paradigms or memes of the emerging era may be 'de-massification' and decentralization, commons, the Long Tail, 'unplugging', stigmergy, adhocracy, P2P, networking and semantic networks, and Amdahl's Law. \nI'm most interested in the nature of future lifestyle and the technologies and design theories that may emerge. I have a particular obsession with the evolution of housing and owner-builder technologies, independent/domestic production technology, the new spectrum of nomadism (Neo-Nomadism, Urban Nomadism, Technomadism, Digital Nomadism, and Mobilism), and the application of 'furnitecture'; furniture and domestic building systems that bridge the line between furniture and architecture through volumetric structures that define zones of activity in open plan spaces rather than the use of fixed walls, thus facilitating adaptive reuse, the use of high-performance structures, and mobility.

It's a vital part of our job, or role, and our offering.\nOn an average day, I could talk to Level 3 Communications (Fucking fantastic 10/10 company), Comcast, Verizon, Sprint, TimeWarner (Mostly bought by Level 3) and none of those companies really give me any serious trouble.\nAnd then there's AT&T.  Mother.  Fucking.  AT&T.\nYou only get an IVR (voice prompts) no matter what number you call, and it takes an average of 7-10 minutes to open a ticket purely by these prompts.  Then, you have to call back, sit in the IVR for another 2.5-4 minutes while you navigate the prompts and try to identify your ticket.\nCurrently, ticket numbers start with 1 number, 1 letter, then a bunch of numbers.  Guess what they are on right now?  5 O (O for Oscar).  Guess what the fucking IVR CANNOT READ AS ANYTHING EXCEPT THE NUMBER ZERO?!  That's fucking right, the fucking letter O.\nSo, prepare your anus to argue with the deluded-ass IVR who asks you if you meant 50090\", you saying \"NO\", and then he asking you to repeat it ad infinitum.\nEventually you'll fucking give up and just repeat the same bullshit number twice in a row, 999-999 for example, and only then will it forward you to an actual human.\nSo you get to a human, and big fucking surprise, it's some shmuck trapped in a call center who has -no fucking clue- how to handle an actual telecom ticket because they are just general customer support.\nThen you'll patiently explain the situation, because you are trying to do your job and so are they.\nAnd then they will tell you they are going to transfer you to the right department to handle that ticket.

If a guy tried to rape your wife, would you really want him around all the time?\nI thought about this for years, and I have two possible theories. \nGeorge and Lorraine get married and have a kid, Marty. As Marty grows older, he looks more and more like their old friend, Calvin. Lorraine swears she hasn't seen Calvin in years, and George decides to believe her, for the sake of the marriage.\nBut eventually, the resemblance becomes so strong that George can't deny it any longer. How could she do this to him? They were destined to be together! He wants to hurt her the way she hurt him, but he can't bring himself to raise a hand against her.\nAnd then he thinks of Biff. Biff has fallen on hard times lately. He could hire Biff to do odd jobs around the house. The more time Biff spends around Lorraine, the more he'll be tempted to finish what he started all those years ago.\nIt's pretty clear that Lorraine has a thing for danger. She falls in love with Marty after he gets hit by a car, then switches to George when he beats up Biff.\nBut danger is like any other drug - to get the same high, you need a larger and larger dose. She starts taking walks in bad neighborhoods. One night, she comes home and tells George that she got mugged. But before George can call the police, she drags him into the bedroom and jumps his bones.\nHer need for danger becomes more and more extreme, until finally, George decides to hire Biff to do odd jobs around the house. The danger of having Biff always around keeps Lorraine constantly excited, and she and George go at it like rabbits."], "votes": ["92"], "type": ["COMMENT"], "hyperlink": ["https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/3p3s0m/what_unexplained_part_of_a_movie_have_you_always/cw2vtw5"]}

People who are dicks or yell and scream get the bare minimum. I genuinely wanted to just help people, and if I could be a help more than I got yelled at, then it was usually a good day. One person being cool about a problem could easily make my day, and I'll do whatever I can do return the favour. Dont scream at me that we fucked up your bill and screwed you over.. I get that a lot and 99% of the time the company didn't do anything wrong. That said if you call and say \"My bill is crazy, can you help me?\" I'm not going to tell you \"it's your own fault, fuck off.\" I'm going to help get rid of charges, or credit you, or whatever I can.

They could have used a lot of other explanations that wan't total baloney. Even no technical explanation can be better than an obviously bad one.\nIn my opinion, the best science fiction is the kind that actually try to look into the real possibilities in some way. That is, to recognize the science and technology we have today, and taking it from there. Although this point particularly applies to futuristic sci-fi, it's also good for sci-fi in general. \nThat's how you get things like Star Trek, where they essentially predicted a lot of things we have to day, like cell phones and tablet computers. \nWhen science fiction set in the future fails to have a basic grasp of what we know today, is almost self defeating.

Obsidian really tapped into the magic that made Star Wars characters so immediately alluring (hell, Boba Fett had like 15 minuets of screen time, yet he's still a fan favorite). Obsidian obviously had more time to flesh these characters out (amazing what you can do with ~30-40hrs of videogame), but the sheer skill with which each character was presented was so consistently stellar. I think \n properly portrays what I mean.\nTo me KoTOR II is the definition of a fantastic derivative work. It honors nearly everything that was good about the original's themes, story, and setting yet provides a completely new perspective on them. I know it's a bit tangential, but this is the main reason I'm not a huge fan of Star Wars: Rebels. It does everything Star Wars and does them well, but that's it. Nothing to make the whole experience feel unique. I feel similarly about the original KoTOR.\nMost of all, KoTOR II actually weaves its videogame nature into its story. It's one thing to see or hear about characters falling to the dark side or joining the light, but its another to actively manipulate your crewmates' perspectives to force them down one road or another. Characters criticize (and practically demonize) you for gaining strength by feeding off death and stealing other people's chances for learning experiences, clearly mocking your reliance on XP points.  I love BioWare games a lot, but I still don't think any of their games have gone this far with integrating story and mechanics (although Dragon Age: Origins did have character manipulation to some extent)."], "votes": ["119"], "type": ["COMMENT"], "hyperlink": ["https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/3p2a1z/what_video_game_had_potential_to_be_great_but/cw2rob0"]}

The story had generally less events than infamous 2, characters got no development (except for the one mission of rapid development the conduits get before they disappear until the finale), and you get 4 powers. Smoke, the original, neon, which they showed off already, concrete, which was super underdeveloped and isn't really a surprise after the whole game built up to it, and video, the one new and honestly pretty great power. \nAnd a lot of the creativity in Infamous 1 and 2 seemed to have lost. Enemies with various powers, swamp creatures, gunmen, and power outages were replaced with concrete dudes of various forms. The same concrete dudes, for the whole game. The world was more realistic to fit the actual city it was in this time, the characters were less colorful, the combat got repetitive, and the story just didn't have as many surprises to it. The plot at the beginning is the same thing at the end, no detours, no additional factors to think about, no real progression.  \nEverything about it feels like 2/3 of what it should have been following up Infamous 2, but instead it just hurts so much to see because it's so almost fucking amazing.

Your name, what you liked to do, who your family was, where you were from, where you wanted to go, and things of that sort.

The actual gameplay is kind of lacking. Go here, kill anything that moves. Go here, grab the thing, kill everything that moves. Go here, kill damn near everything, try to keep these guys alive but you don't have it. I get it, kinda dull.\nWhat you're missing isn't the campaign, but the story. The relationship between Cortana and John-117 evolves, grows, and pulls on heartstrings.\nFor those of you not following, Cortana is an AI, and its established in universe that AIs suffer a process called Rampancy after approximately 7 years. Its a kind of inverted dementia, where instead of forgetting everything, they \n everything. Ever little detail of everything they've ever done, every system they've touched, person they've talked to, place they've been. \nCortana has been, literally, in Johns head for years. So you get to witness the forging of a relationship in which \n is possibly the best word I could use. These two characters come to rely on, trust, and confide in each other that no two humans could ever do. In that time, she's witnessed unspeakable horrors, been tortured by a semi-omnipotent and completely malevolent \n, and sacrificed herself for John, and she cannot forget \n of it.\nMeanwhile, the Spartans have been surgically altered, brainwashed, and relentless trained. Cortana isn't capable of forgetting the amount of pain John endured as young child, although he is.\nIts a kind of insanity, Rampancy is. Cortana knows what coming, and she knows its going to be bad. She has an electronic infinity to consider her own sentience, her own life, if thats the right word. She comes to terms with it, not because she's ready, but because she knows she can't stop it.\nTowards the end of Halo 4, you realize, this isn't just a guy whose computer is out of date. Imagine if you made one friend in Middle School. And for the rest of your life, that one person was the only person you ever really talked to. This is watching the love of your life, the only person who has ever known you, understood you, needed you, and worried about you, slowly go insane.\nJohn is losing the only person he has ever known. And so is Cortana.\n. There is no cure, no pill to treat the symptoms. This is a thing that is going to happen, and nothing in the universe, including the woman who created Cortana, can do to fix it.\nHad me sobbing like a baby. Still does, in fact.\nIf you play Halo, don't worry about the campaign. Thats not what the game is about. Its about the \n.

It wasn't a world to level through then ignore back then, it was a homeland in which you traveled and learned new things in all the time.\nThey could have kept going that direction. Expanding the rabbit holes of mystery and easter eggs, introducing more traditional fantasy elements, creatures, and hidden areas. Having more live events, more story, more to discover. Instead they went the cheap and easy route and began focusing more and more on raiding, creating smaller faster dungeons (which were more tube like, than labyrinthian), and arena/pvp e-sports (which made classes dull via balance). \nBut alas the numbers showed that that is what people wanted, so the way they went was the correct way for the mindless masses.
