{"url": ["https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/3p5edl/serious_what_is_the_scariest_experience_in_your/"], "text": ["I am going to copy and paste \n from a similar thread:\nI lived in a friend's castle that was infamous for being apparently haunted. It was a beautiful place but could be quite eery.\nOf my numerous as-of-yet unexplained experiences there, a few stand out:\nI lived in a large self-contained apartment on the third floor. There was one large room at the end that I used for storage and the only way to get to it was through a door at the end of my bed and to the right. For a period of about two weeks, I would wake up nearly every single night, roll over and see that it was either 2:59 or 3:00.\nThe last night that it happened, I rolled over and saw the clock just as it clicked over to 3:00. I didn't feel well. I could see in dim detail the entirety of my room since someone had left on the floodlights that illuminate the exterior of the castle. All of a sudden, my blankets started to slide slowly down my body. I yanked them back up. Twice more in happened and twice more I pulled my blankets back up before they slid off completely. Then, the door knob to the 'storage' room started to squeak distinctly. The door slowly opened, swinging into the storage room. A strong, steady stream of dry, warm hair flowed into my bedroom. I was terrified. I called out and said, \"I don't know who you are but I'm really tired and would like to sleep. Could you scare me another night instead?\". The door slowly closed and clicked shut. I grabbed my blankets and, surprisingly, fell fast asleep. The next day I put a hook and eye on the door to keep it closed even after I determined that the door knob was not faulty.\nAnother time, I was up in my office in the same apartment when I received a call from the secretary asking if I could come down to fetch some money to make a deposit (the castle was open for events and tours). I duly did but didn't have time to make it to the bank right away. I brought the money (about $1000) up to my apartment and set it on top of the upright piano directly to the left of my desk (which was in the middle of the room) and continued to work. A short time later, I received a call saying they needed some of the money back at the desk. I said, \"no problem\", hung up and turned to get the money and it was gone.\nI tore my apartment apart looking for it and didn't find it. I went downstairs to say I had lost it and ran into the owner (my friend) to tell her. She calmly said, \"You'll find it exactly where you left it\". I went back upstairs, opened the door and looked over and sure enough there it was. I grabbed it and ran as fast as I could back down, burst into the library where the owner was and held it up. She laughed and said, \"You look like you've just seen a ghost\".\nOne of the earliest experiences was my first day there. I was in the upper grand hall when I saw a man appear to break away from his tour group and walk down the gallery branching off from the hall, exiting the last set of doors on the right (which led to a room adjacent and parallel to the gallery, they shared an arcade of five sets of doors between them). When I followed after and got to the last set of doors, I noticed that not only did they swing in (and I hadn't seen them open), they also had two chairs side by side in front of them and had been bolted shut for years.\nMy last story for now happened the evening the castle had been listed for sale, which was sad for all of us involved. I went out to see the concert of a well-known friend of mine and got back to the castle around 3:00. As was usual, I made my rounds making sure that lights were off and doors and windows were shut and locked. At the end, I made my way up to my apartment. To get to my apartment, you have to go to the end of the gallery and through a jib door and into a small hall roughly ten feet square. In own corner is a spiral staircase that makes two complete revolutions before hitting the third floor. The only light in the lower part of the hall is a single floor lamp. The ceilings are about 16 feet tall, so it gets darker as you ascend.\nI got to the top of the stairs where there is another hall of similar dimensions with a door to my apartment. As I am about to open my door, I hear one of the cats meowing below. They were not supposed to be in the main wing of the castle. I peered down at the corner of the square opening through which the circular stairs ascend and saw the cat down on the second floor. She was looking up but not at me. All of a sudden, the staircase started to creak quite loudly, as it does only when someone is walking up it. I froze and the sound stopped. Slowly, I made my way over to another corner and craned my neck to look down. I couldn't see far down the stairs below me but, just around the the corner from where I could see there was the shadow of the handrail on the wall in the lamp light, and also the shadow of a man. I went to my apartment and locked the door."], "votes": ["13"], "type": ["COMMENT"], "hyperlink": ["https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/3p5edl/serious_what_is_the_scariest_experience_in_your/cw3gva5"]}

We never had anybody live with us at the time this happened. Anyhow - the house we lived in was bombed during WW2 and rebuilt somewhere in the late 1940's/early 50's. \nWhen my mother and I got back home she unlocked the front door and I entered the house first. As I am passing the stairs which were on my right I clearly see a full figure of a small boy walk right into me and through me, I didn't feel anything all I saw was a VERY clear full bodied boy, I can even describe what he was wearing - he had an old Victorian style hat on (like a farmers hat) a brown blazer with a waist coat and white shirt, shorts, socks pulled up as far as they could go and shoes. His head was facing down so I couldn't see his face.

In the same house every morning (weekends) around 06:30'ish everybody else was asleep.

That was the scariest paranormal experience I have ever had, a truly terrifying thing to see! I moved rooms after that night and slept with a nightlight for a good 10 years since then! \nI have walked into a haunted bar and felt really heavy and sick, like I was going to faint, yet when I left the bar I felt perfectly fine. The bar was featured on many TV programs in the early 2000's, it used to be a church, until it was converted into a bar. That left many un-rested spirits (not the drinkable ones). \nNow that I am in my 20's I still experience unexplained things, but I haven't seen anything in quite a while now, which I feel rather upset about. The other week I did hear what sounded like my dog whimpering at my door, she was upstairs asleep at the time as I opened my door to see what the noise was, nobody was there. Later that night we all heard (apart from the dog which was strange) three clear knocks at the door, now - the dog always barks when someone knocks at the door, but she didn't at this.

The couple had even left money to help keep it afloat (they had had no children). The couple and their dogs were buried on the property after they had died. The maid lived there a few years after to keep the place going and then she, too, died. The estate was never used as its intended purposes and finally was opened as a heritage estate to host parties and weddings. Many guests would come to me saying they saw apparitions and reflections in the main bedroom (this would be the matron of the house). The garage was haunted by the husband. But both the maid and the matron of the house would roam all the floors. After that night - whenever I was in the house alone - i would always hear a broom sweeping the main floors. \nMy coworkers had many stories of their own - one worker was chased out of the house having things thrown at him until he left. He never came back naturally. Other workers told of stories of their items being places in different spots whenever they returned to the office. And another was when the one girl was taking inventory of the books in the library - many of the books had inscriptions from teh husband to the wife. She, like me, talked to the house too. She was saying - aww look at all these love notes, how truly romantic. She looked up and saw in the reflection of the windows, the matron sitting next to her on the lounge watching her read the books!"], "votes": ["2"], "type": ["COMMENT"], "hyperlink": ["https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/3p5edl/serious_what_is_the_scariest_experience_in_your/cw3l55t"]}

{"url": ["https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/3p5edl/serious_what_is_the_scariest_experience_in_your/"], "text": ["These stories may not be scary, they're more so comforting to me. I'll start by saying I'm not very religious but have had weird bouts with the \"paranormal.\" I\u2019ve often tried to come up with excuses for the paranormal things I\u2019ve experienced, but they\u2019re often half-baked and still leave me wondering. My mother is the same way. She's never told me a story that sounded ridiculous, or that I learned to be a lie, she's just a really honest, grounded person in general. That being said,\nMy parents bought the house that my mother grew up in from her parents. When I was 8, my grandparents were over for the night and my grandpa collapsed on his way down the hall. He had had a massive blood clot that made its way to his heart. He passed away a few days later at the hospital 5 minutes down the road.\nMy mom was present for his passing in the hospital, and for the next 3 days or so, strange things happened in our, (formerly his,) home. As well as one situation at my grandma's new home.\nHe had slept in what is now my room for multiple years before my parents purchased the house, because of his PTSD from WWII. He would thrash around in his sleep at times, and ended up hitting my grandma by accident quite often. So, he moved into my room. My grandpa was a snare drummer in his teens and twenties, and I have a full drum kit in my room. \nMy mom is very adament that the night he died, she was awoken immediatley by a tap on the ride cymbal. Then another, another, and another. With each tap, she simultaneously  thought aloud in her head, her name, her sister's name, her youngest brother's name, and her eldest brother's name. \nAccording to her, there was no analysis after the fact, such as \"I think there were 4 taps because of his 4 children.\" She had \"heard\" their names in her head at the same time the taps occurred.\nThe second strange thing was the time the wooden carousel was found in the center of the room. My grandpa was a great woodworker, he loved model ships, fixing furniture, etcetera. He had made a little wooden carousel, no bigger than 4 inches in diameter, with hand painted people on horses, the whole bit. It sat on a shelf in our \"office\" (computer room.) \nThe second day after my grandpa had passed, my mom walked into the office to see it standing upright in the middle of the floor. Even if it had somehow fallen off the shelf, how would it have rolled there? Past a table? And landed upright? This thing had been on a shelf for 2 years. We didn't have a cat or anything. And my dad or sister would have admitted to knocking it over and forgetting it. To boot, nothing else on the shelf had so much as shifted, just the one thing my grandpa had a connection to.\nThe third thing that happened is the most cliche, and least believable. The alarm in the guest room, which is the room my grandpa had collapsed into from the hallway, would routinely go off at strange hours. Notably in the evening, or at ridiculous hours of the night. My mom had made a habit of coming downstairs, saying \u201cHi Dad,\u201d and turning it off, kind of as a coping mechanism. \nShe finally got tired of this thing going off every night, and unplugged it. The following night, it went off in the early AM.\nThere were no batteries, not even a battery compartment. She turned it off, and it never went off again.\nAnd that was the end of \u201cmy grandpa\u201d visiting.\nAs I said, we aren't a superstitious or religious family. After all, if we were religious, we would be sure he was up in heaven, not setting off alarms for shits and giggles. \nBonus story from my grandma:\nMy grandpa was cremated, and my grandma had an experience the night she took his urn home. While she laid on her side in bed, crying and talking out loud to my grandpa as if he were there, she felt a hand slide over her shoulder and grab hers. She was terrified, she closed her eyes tight and stopped talking. Apparently the hand never stopped holding hers, over the course of 20 minutes. She felt a calm come over her. She fell asleep.\nShe told my mom this story in confidence, and the one time she brought it up my grandma became very quiet and insisted it was only a dream. She won\u2019t talk about it anymore. Even if it was a dream, its pretty beautiful to me."], "votes": ["7"], "type": ["COMMENT"], "hyperlink": ["https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/3p5edl/serious_what_is_the_scariest_experience_in_your/cw3aihr"]}

Also, even though I experienced this, I'm still quite skeptical about paranormal stuff. \nIt was around the late 60s maybe early 70s and my Uncle \"D\" was newly married to his longtime girlfriend \"A\", and they rented a small house in Glen Lyon, Pennsylvania to raise a family. They had a baby \"R\" about a year later, and although a happy couple, they would often visit Grandma's house complaining about weird things happening in their house. I recall hearing them talk about many footsteps, as if a line of people were shuffling to work to punch a time clock.\nOne day D and A came to Grandma's house crying and saying that so many weird things were happening that they tried getting a priest to perform an exorcism, and all the people they contacted said \"Yeah, we saw that movie too.\" I guess the movie The Exorcist had recently been released and lots of people were very spooked by it.\nSo my Aunt \"H\" and I decided we'd go and spend the night with them to report back on if we see anything weird, or if D is just nuts. He was a hardcore \"Greaser\" back in the days, getting in \"rumbles\" and races, etc., and a gun-totin' hillbilly, so he's not the type of person to get worked up to the point of tears over stupid shit.\nDinner at their house went without a hitch, it was delicious and \"A\" seemed like a proud queen of her kitchen. As we retired to the living room to watch TV, D sat in his La-Z-Boy chair and placed a loaded double-barrel 12 ga shotgun at his side. I thought this might be a little unsafe with the baby crawling around on the floor, but wtf, it's his house.\nDuring a commercial on TV, the little baby R started screaming like crazy, his eyes bugging out like he saw something awful. It looked like a bad movie effect when he \"Popped it in reverse\" (as D put it) and crawled very fast backwards under an end table screaming all the while. Uncle D comforted him and A came in from the kitchen to put him in his crib with a pacifier. It was kinda weird, but I figured it's uncle D's kid, so he's probably fucked up in the brain too.\nSo things settle down and we're back to watching TV when suddenly the front door slams open and someone runs up the stairs. D grabs his shotgun and I'm right behind him as we run up the stairs after it. I figured it was A's little brother getting in trouble again and didn't want D to accidently shoot him. But all I can see going up the stairs is uncle D's big fat ass in front of me.\nWe get to the top of the stairs and a closet at the other end of the hall slams shut and I see the handle jiggling as if someone is trying to lock it or something. Without even thinking, uncle D immediately lets loose with both barrels KABOOOM! This completely obliterates the part of the door with the handle, and the door creaks open to reveal nobody in there.\nThe concussion from the shotgun blast deafened us completely and D and I were both poking our ears going \"Nurg, nrg nrgh...\" trying to get our hearing back, and as my hearing slowly returned, I hear A in the kitchen screaming. My first thought was that some of the shot went through the wall and hit her.\nWe both ran downstairs and to the kitchen where we saw A up against the sink screaming and all the cupboards were open with dishes shuffling onto the ground like cards. I noticed that the room was freezing cold and we could see our breaths. \nI looked behind me and saw my Aunt H grabbing the baby out of the crib and running down the driveway to the car as fast as her chubby legs would carry her. We GTFO and jump in the car (Jeep, actually), but for some reason D can't get the car to start. The women were in hysterics, screaming that the curtains in the house were blowing but the windows were closed, lights turning on/off and stuff like that. D was under the hood of the car and was finally able to get it started, but as we drove he complained that something was tugging at the wheel and he was having a hard time keeping control of the vehicle. I said \"Please don't bring these ghosts to Grandma's house, she's got enough problems.\" haha.\nFrom what D told me later, it seems the house was built on top of a mine that had caved in, killing the miners and swallowing the homes with their families in them. According to him, the house was built right on top of the disaster.\nTL;DR - I have a weird family"], "votes": ["4"], "type": ["COMMENT"], "hyperlink": ["https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/3p5edl/serious_what_is_the_scariest_experience_in_your/cw3hjac"]}

The best friend is the rock the main character leans on for support. Even the fights between friends usually end before the credits roll, because the main character NEEDS their best friend. Audiences love it. They dream about having a relationship like that - To have adventures with someone whose 100% trustworthy and will always be there. \nBeing happily married is being \"married to my best friend\", in that way. I have close friends/besties outside of my husband, of course. He can't replace those relationships. But...He is my \"Hollywood\" best friend. He provides the comfort, happiness, and love of years together. It doesn't get stale being with him. When we fight, we make up.

I was laying in bed, which was positioned in the middle of the wall so there was space on both sides to walk. I had a door to the bathroom and a door to a hallway. So I'm laying there and waiting to fall asleep when I hear a door rattle. It's the bathroom door. No biggie, the window is probably open in there. Couple minutes later, the other door shakes. That got my attention because there aren't any windows that open on that side. So I'm questioning whether I want to get up or not when I start hearing footsteps in my room. They start on one side of the bed and walk all around to the other side. At this point I'm pretty scared and I don't really want to get up. I'm not sure how long I listened to the footsteps but it felt like forever. \nThen they stop. And I hear this rattling, deep sounding breath. I've never known paralyzing fear before, but that did it for me. I couldn't move a muscle. Then the footsteps started up again. I must have listened for 15 minutes. Then something in me jolted me and I took off. Ran downstairs to where my parents were (they were fighting). My mom said I was super pale. \nCouldn't help myself. Started crying. I've never been so terrified before, or since. My grandma had a blessed rosary and my mom gave it to me to put around my bed's headboard. Never heard anything since. \nIt was at this point where I decided to go back to church. Nothing really strengthens your faith quite like an experience like that. I have a tattoo of a phoenix rising from a trinity symbol on my back now. Every time I see it, I remember that day.

I had been struggling to acclimate to the magnet school I had tested into, and was trying to cope with my mother's cancer diagnosis around the same time.  My parents wanted to talk to my teacher, we'll call her Mrs. F, about some extra work I might be able to do to help make up for some assignments that I had missed.  Mrs. F was not immediately keen to the idea of extra credit, but was willing to hear suggestions and make recommendations to help me improve.\nAs my dad enters the classroom, he notices a few small animal cages on a cupboard.  Mrs. F proudly mentions that several of her 8th grade students brought in their pet mice for their discussion on \n.  My dad had a pet rat during his teenage years, so he readily approached the cages hoping to get a glimpse of one of the fuzzy things.  It was at that moment that he realized that one of the cages was completely empty.\nUh oh.\nMrs. F apologizes profusely for the interruption, hoping that my parents wouldn't mind coming back after she's recovered the rodent.  My parents wouldn't leave, instead insisting on helping my teacher find the \n escaped mice roaming the classroom.  For nearly an hour my mom, dad, and Mrs. F are on their hands and knees scrounging for two tiny mice.  Happily, both mice were safely recovered, and not a word was spoken of the search to me or the poor student who's mice were nearly lost.\nI didn't hear the story until about a year later, 8th grade, and again Mrs. F was my teacher.  I had just recited a poem I wrote at 2 o'clock in the morning about my mother, her illness, and her passing about two weeks prior.  There was not a dry eye in the room.  It was then that Mrs. F, with tears on her face, told my class about how she met my mom and how eager she and my dad were to help her catch those sneaky mice.\nMrs. F was sympathetic to my struggles, and gave me some opportunities to make up the work that I missed in the latter half of 7th grade.  Unfortunately, I could not maintain the minimum required GPA to stay at the magnet school in the year following my mother's death.  I never really got the chance to thank Mrs. F for all that she did for me in those two years.\nIf you're reading this Mrs. F, you are one of the main reasons I'm graduating medical school next year.

Feet grabbing, doors slamming, whispers in my ear, seeing shadows, one time a necklace was ripped from my neck. I'm not sure how that happened. \nBut the thing I remember the most is that one time I woke up and saw (quite clearly) a man with a broken jaw standing at the foot of my bed. I started to scream... At the very same time my twin started screaming in a different room across the house. \nShe claimed to have seen the same thing. Down to the clothes he was wearing. \nEdit: shit, I completely forgot. A month ago, I took my childhood dog to my mother's house because she was getting extremely old and sick, and my mother didn't want my little sister to see her pass. I was getting ready for work in my bathroom when I heard the loudest barking outside my door. Like big, territorial barking. I knew I had turned all of the TV's off in my house, so the only other place it could have come from was my chihuahua, which is unlikely because he's only got this annoying yap. When I finally got the courage, I threw open the bathroom door and ran to grab my other dog. I locked him in my room, then I searched the house for what might have been a stray dog in my house.\nNothing. There was no dog, no noise from the television, nobody outside, nothing. I called my mom, fearing the worst, and sure enough my dog had passed away. She was a German Shepherd. \nFor this reason, I like to think that maybe she's around protecting us still.

We are super silly together and do things like have wrestling matches, chase each other around the kitchen island (usually ends in me giggling too hard to keep running and then him tackling me lol), and make up stupid stories together while we people-watch on the weekends. We also are both really outdoorsy and can hike together and do new activities, sometimes chatting as we go along and sometimes not talking at all and just enjoying the silence. He gives me the space I need in life to not feel suffocated - for example, right now I'm sitting outside on our patio while I type this and he's inside watching football, and we'll probably stay like this for at least a few hours this afternoon before eating dinner at some point - and I indulge his need to always be learning by doing new things that I otherwise wouldn't (latest thing we've done is scuba diving which is actually super fun).\nBasically everything is made 100x better just by him being there, and everything is a bit duller and not as exciting if he's away.

The storms will come, the winds will blow, and the water may become turbulent, but the boat is safely at anchor. It rises with the waves, and its direction may turn here and there in the wind, but you're always safely in the same spot once the storm passes.\nBeing married to your best friend, for me, means I don't have to tell her how my day went. She can see it in my face, hear it in my voice, and I can do the same for her. I know that no matter how bad a day work may have been, my wife is going to hug me and I can hold her, I can feel her head on my shoulder and her arms on my back. I close my eyes and just breathe deep and feel her hug me and it doesn't matter at all what happened that day, my boat is safe at anchor.\nEven fiscally, we have each others' backs. When our first daughter was born, I was driving my dream car(350z) that I had paid off working in high school, and she didn't even have to ask, I traded it in for a Prius for her and our daughter and I took her dumpy Sentra. Then a couple years later, I had made it back into a nice VW, then we found out she was pregnant again with our third kid and would need a minivan... And there went my VW, I got her Prius and she got a minivan. Without both of our income, we wouldn't have been able to almost pay off the Prius in the meantime (it was a 72mo loan and we're going to have it paid off by the 46th month). And yeah it sucked having to give up the cars I grew to appreciate driving, but now we're focusing on my student loans, so it's incredibly reassuring to know that my concerns and problems in life are valid and cared about by someone else, to the point that they would sacrifice their resources to help me resolve my problems.\nThe best thing about being married is being on the same page and commitment level to someone. You don't have to impress them, they've accepted you for who you are. And so the things that get between you become opportunities to make you closer, because you learn that the more you love someone, the more you're willing to sacrifice for them. So you really put them first in your life without consciously knowing it, but you're a team and you succeed or fail together. \nThe important thing is to only get married to someone who holds the same values as you, you have to both agree on what is most important in life in order to happily coexist. Relationships aren't like a lock and you're just searching for the perfect key to fit, they're a combination lock and you forgot the combination, but with both of you working together on it, if you're both persistent enough, you'll figure it out eventually."], "votes": ["25"], "type": ["COMMENT"], "hyperlink": ["https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/3p4zds/serious_happy_spouses_of_reddit_why_is_marriage/cw3djvf"]}

Lots of weird tapping noises and sometimes your stuff would move from where you thought you left it. But with 4 roommates, shit happens, and old houses make noise. So we all just ignored it. \nWe had been there for about six months when I had my first experience. I had come home from work and closed and bolted the front door, as was my habit. It was around 730-8pm on a Friday, and no one else was home. I went to my room to change out of my work clothes, and almost immediately, I hear a crashing sound akin to every breakable item in the kitchen hitting the floor simultaneously. When I went to check, nothing was amiss, except for one thing: the front door, which I had carefully bolted, was WIDE OPEN. Actually flapping in the breeze. I grabbed my stuff and spent the night on a friend's couch, and pretty much refused to be alone in the house from that point on.

I remember the feeling of knowing that, if I don't go see him then I will never see him again but it didn't matter because he had passed before my family even made it to the hospital.\nAfter visiting my uncle I was sitting outside his house waiting for the rest of the family to come outside and I \"saw\" him being dragged on the ground and covered in blood.  It was a quick flash but it was so real and I felt like I wasn't going to see him alive again either.\nHe was shot on his farm in South Africa two years later, he didn't die immediately so his feet were tied to the back of a pick up and dragged around until he eventually died.\nWhile I was living abroad my brother called me to say that he was engaged, I had never met his fianc\u00e9 before, and I knew without a doubt that there were going to be problems with his second child.  I knew that either his wife or the baby was going to die.\nLater, when they told me they were expecting again, I was very worried about them and she eventually had a miss carriage at 5 1/2 months.\nI was visiting my family and when I said goodbye to my grandmother she made me promise to come back for her funeral.  She was healthy and in her late 70's so I made light of her feeling but still promised her I would.\n6 Months later she fell and broke her hip, she was being transported by ambulance from one hospital to another that had more experience with hip replacements when her ambulance lost control and rolled.

It freaked my mom out because my gran was not in any danger and she was the only person in the room with her.\nThese stand out the most, I don't like having these experiences but sometimes they come in handy for every day situations.

She holds full on conversations. acts like there is a physical being there. blames them. gets mad at them. laughs. etc.\nNow normally thats nothing too far fetched. But after watching the entirety of Fringe at least 6 times, some things just sorta click.\nIt is explained that young children are more perceptive and open to more stimuli than older people are. As explained by one of the shows characters, \" at birth, the human mind is infinitely capable, but each force that it encounters (social, physical, intellectual) begins a process he called \"limitation\" - a diminishing of that potential.\" They can(in the tv show) see things that arent there, can cross over into other universes, and a myriad of other things. Now they dont do this all on there own. \nThere was a drug created: \"Cortexiphan was designed in hopes of limiting this \"limitation\", preventing the natural shrinking of brainpower, resulting in people with increased mental ability. Due to the fact that Cortexiphan only prevented the limitation of the mind's potential rather than reversing it, it had to be administered to young children (whose potential had not yet been limited) in order to produce any results.\"\nSo taking all that into account, ive often wondered, if she is actually seeing something and conversing with it. Now obviously she wasnt drugged with Cortexiphan.

It was primarily outdoors, but it was getting late and people wanted to do something different, as up to that point we'd just been playing normal party games and eating. Someone got the bright idea to walk to a nearby cemetery.\nThe walk itself was fairly uneventful, but good God it was long. We must have walked several blocks, at least, and these are Midwestern boonie blocks. Cemetery happened to be up on a hill, real old place by the look of it, it had these giant wrought-iron fences and a gate straight out of the Old Country. I remember there were tons of mausoleums around, and by the time we got there whatever streetlights that were left were gone. It was \n I couldn't see two feet in front of me. Took a picture of some friends - it was barely recognizable. Only thing we had to see by were some flashlights a couple people brought and the tiny lights of a rare cellphone.\nWe walked maybe four or five feet into this cemetery, and keep in mind it wrapped around in sort of a reverse L shape I guess. Intense feeling of just dread comes over everyone. Like we shouldn't be there. We don't belong. We stand around awkwardly near one of the mausoleums for a few minutes before someone suggests we head back to the party, unsurprisingly we all agreed.\nNow, keep in mind I didn't mention the one person who didn't feel this way among the entire group. Her name was Cat (obviously not real, but y'know). She thought we were all just being cowards, and had no problem telling us so. Her bright idea was to head back into the cemetery as we started heading out, and run alongside us on the road jumping on and weaving in and out between gravestones.\nYou know that feeling of dread I was talking about? It got kicked up to 11 when she started jumping on gravestones. I swear I heard voices nobody knew talking to us. Took us a good ten minutes of yelling at Cat to knock it off before she stopped and joined us on the actual road, outside the cemetery.

We moved to a new house when I was in gr.4. The basement was unfinished and full of centipedes. Whenever you went down there, it was like slowly going under water...and it always felt as though someone was behind you. Years after we grew up and left home...My mother rented it out to a co worker of hers. They ended up moving out because they couldn't stand the foot steps and one day all the kitchen cupboards where open. When I was pregnant with my son, I had a roomate. Big bellies and summer time don't mix..so I was sleeping in the living room to get full access to the ac. I thought I was dreaming at first when I noticed a pair of arms on my shoulders sort of holding me down. When I fully opened my eyes..there was a balding, elderly man bent down with his hands on his knees, staring in my face. As I struggled to get up..he slowly faded away into the corner of the room. I came charging into my roommates room. It was then she admitted to hearing my struggle and was too afraid to come help me. A year and a half ago, my grandmother was passing. I loved her like a mother and was heart broken. I sat with her one day and she said my grandfather (who has already passed) was telling her to \" quit fooling around and get up\". So she figured he wanted her there. Family drama ensued...as it does when stress is involved. So no one was with her when she passed. She was always a shy person and was lost without my grandpa and  was pretty angry she passed alone. A few nights later..I have a dream that my grandma is talking on my left side and my grandpa is on my right. It's pitch black and I can't see them.  Both are talking at the same time. He is asking where she is and she is saying that she is stuck and can't find him. After she was cremated and their ashes mixed. They were buried together..I never had that dream again.

About a year ago I woke up from what I thought was a nap. It was dark, but it isn't unusual for it to be dark by 5:30 during the winter. The first thing I did was go check on my grandma, but I found her asleep in bed. This seemed odd to me  but assumed she wasn't feeling well and left her alone. Then I went to the phone to call my mom, who I assumed was coming from work. She didn't answer. Decided to text my dad, no response. Not knowing if anybody wanted me start some food or not, I sat down with a book for about an hour, at which time I started to get worried because no one was coming home. Then, from the other part of the house, and I almost have a fucking heart attack, my mom comes from her bed room dressed in night clothes. I'm probably looking at her like a crazy person and I'm like what the fuck are you doing home? And she's like, its 6 in the morning. And I'm like, wtf, no, I took a nap at 1 in the afternoon and woke up at 5:30 in the afternoon. And she said, no, you went to sleep last night after you watched the Big Bang. I start thinking back, and I say no, that was 2 days ago. My mom gives me the \"I don't have time for your bullshit\" face. I kept peppering her with questions though. Like did I sleep for 24 hours or something? She keeps saying no. Its like she doesn't remember the day that I remember. She remembers me watching tv, then going to bed, and to her that was last night. To me that was two nights ago. See, when I went to bed after I watched tv. I did wake up the next morning, but not at 6, more like at 9, and I spoke to my grandmother and my aunt. Then at around 1 I went to take a nap. But that day nobody else seems to remember but me. There was no point in asking my grandmother about it, because she had dementia. It worried me so badly I discussed it with my psychiatrist, because one of my hugest fears is getting schizophrenia, but he evaluated me and none of the red flags popped up for it. I don't drink, or take any drugs other than what I'm prescribed by a doctor, and I'm pretty much a homebody so its was really easy to track my day when my grandma was alive and everything revolved around her.

I was visiting a very good friend whose mother happened to be very ill. While I was there, her mother passed away. Months later, she moved into her mother's old house and I begin renting the other house. Periodically, the door bell would ring and no one would be there. Mind you, this house was in the country and the nearest neighbor was at least a mile away. After investigating, we found that the door bell had no batteries and was not hard wired. We chalked it up to mamma checking on us. \nI also happened to work nights at the time. One evening I was getting ready for work at about 9 pm. I walked through the kitchen and noticed a light on in the barn. No big deal, I thought Kate must have been checking on the horses. As I walked back through the kitchen moments later, I saw the light was off in the barn but I noticed a tall, thin elderly man in a white t-shirt walking across the yard. He disappeared into the corn field next to the property. I went and asked Kate if she had been in the barn or if she had someone over. She replied no, so I told her what I saw.  She said it sounded like it was daddy. Her daddy, who had passed away decades ago and who I'd never met. \nLastly, a few years later, Kate was diagnosed with cancer. Since we were unsure of her chances, I went ahead and bought a house so I wouldn't be kicked out by her children if she happened to pass away.  We kept in touch and it was November 2012 that I realized I hadn't heard from her recently. Something in my heart told me she had passed away. I began checking the local obituaries but found nothing. Then one Sunday night I received a voice mail. My phone didn't ring, I had no missed calls, just the voice mail showed up. It was Kate's daughter telling me she had died. I was struck immediately with grief and guilt because I had not talked to her in her last couple of months and I didn't get to say good bye.  That night, about 1 am I was woken from my sleep. I felt a weight on the end of my bed as if someone had sat down. I tried to move but couldn't (I attribute it to sleep paralysis).  I began to panic until I felt a hand on my shoulder. Suddenly I was able to move and I couldn't do anything but cry. I knew it was Kate visiting me to say good bye and tell me everything was OK.  \nAlso of note, in her family, they always released balloons at funerals. Since mamma's funeral and through all the years since, I would see random, single purple balloons in places they had no business being. Both mamma and Kate's favorite color was purple. I  believe its their way of saying hello.

The security of knowing we are in this together for the long haul means we are free to try things and fail, and we will be there for each other. It's also a product of our particular approach to marriage, which is that we believe the success of our relationship is dependent on other people as well, and is a gift to other people. We need other friends to share certain hobbies with us, to help us remember who we were before we met each other, and to expose us to things we can't share with one another. Also, we support each other so that we have more to give to other people in our lives. And we have friends who have had really shit situations in their personal lives, and we try to make our tiny home a place they can feel safe and unload and be loved. We always say we want the love in our house to make it an oasis in the desert. \nEdit adding: One of the most important effects of knowing we are there for each other forever is that it is safe to confront how terrible we are sometimes. Before I got married, I had NO idea how selfish I am, or how shallow or vain. It's only because my husband makes me feel so safe that I can tackle that nonsense head-on.

There are those who can say \"not us, we just go together and never have any difference of opinion\". That is great for them. For my Husband and I we work so hard at it. We have been through job changes, being so broke the power was turned off, loss of a parent, loss of a baby and we have only been married 6 years. Both under 30. For Hubby and I, we are growing up together. \nWhy is it so awesome? Marriage makes you own your bad behavior, to stand up and say 'You are right, I shouldn't of done that'. It teaches you to be forgiving, patient and to think of someone else other than yourself. We have a 2 year old daughter and she has brought us closer than I ever thought possible. Looking at someone you both created is kind of insane. When she was born, I believed more than ever that my Husband and I were supposed to be together to bring this human into the world.\nWe are both super realistic about our relationship and our life goals. He is the one person who can tell me when I am being super bitch and I will hear him. We are constantly planning and talking through everything. Hubby recently got a new job so I have been his cheerleader. Taking our daughter to surprise him for lunch at work, asking lots of questions about his day and his new clients. Making him feel how proud we are of him. Marriage gives you a whole other level of thoughtfulness and fulfillment in seeing someone else happy. \nThe big deal about marriage is that it fucking rocks. If done properly by two people who want to be in the marriage. It is the best sex, the best talks, the best laughs, the best adventures.

I'm pretty sure of it, because that's how Trojan viruses work.  They're disguised as something harmless or meaningful, such as a picture, a song, a video, or even a basic piece of software that would be useful to the user, but once the file in question is opened and installed (in the case of software), the virus goes to town.  You still have the original file in question, which could remain on your system, but now you have that nasty virus.\nPerhaps Cypher went into the code and modified it in that way.  He probably secretly contacted the Agents, and arranged to meet with one of them in that program.

I had been texting a girl I was into off and on for the past few days and we were just shooting the shit. She asked what I was doing. I explained that my cousin and I were just talking about weed and how I had just recently smoked for the first time (this was true). She asks, \"do you have any on you?\" I say, \"of course not lol I'm about to go to the airport and through customs, I'd be fucked.\" Phone rings, it's her, I answer. I hear her dad say \"well this is (girl's name)'s father you've been texting so you're already fucked. \nI was in houston, he lived in houston, I start freaking out. \nHe says \"I'm coming to the airport to break every fucking bone in your body\" and several other threats. Having met the man before, I believed that he would because he was kind of insane anyway. I frantically tried to explain myself out of the situation.\nOf course now I am fully aware he was just trying to freak me out because I was 16 and a dumb kid. But goddammit it worked. I spent the entire time at the airport terrified.\nThe story ends with me having to call my parents and explain the situation. Which apparently resulted in my own father calling the guy and saying something...I'm not sure what exactly...but I've never heard from the girl's dad again. Never made it with the girl either. \nTL;DR girls dad saw I was texting his daughter about getting high, he calls and threatens to kill me, I spend the day at the airport horrified.

We decided to go to Denny's when we got back to campus. It was somewhat busy, so we had to wait to be seated. As we were waiting, the lights all went out and some sort of alarm started going off in the kitchen. Cue mass confusion and people complaining to waitstaff as though they control the building's power.\nSomeone had the bright idea to get up and leave, without paying. More people started to get up to leave, so employees went and blocked the exit. My friends and I decided that this wasn't worth it, but the employees blocking the door were just yelling at everyone to sit down at their tables. We told them that we hadn't even been seated yet, and they just repeated that we needed to sit down at our table.\nAfter a few minutes, someone had called the police. When they got there, we told the officers that the employees wouldn't let us leave even though we hadn't even been seated, let alone ordered anything. The officers told them, \"Yeah, you can't keep them here for no reason.\" We went next door to McDonald's instead.\nAnd that's the story of the time I was held captive in a Denny's."], "votes": ["120"], "type": ["COMMENT"], "hyperlink": ["https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/3oo3s3/halloween_megathread/cvz2b3l"]}

{"url": ["https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/3p3c5o/what_is_the_most_ingenious_way_you_have_seen_a/"], "text": ["My father in law (now deceased) used to do this to my husband when my husband was 16 or 17.  My FIL started up his own engineering firm and through sheer hard work and good management made it into something he was proud of.\nAnyway, he used to take my husband (his son) with him on weekends/school holidays/after school etc to ground him in the business so that he learnt some valuable skills, but essentially started at the bottom.  He got no extra privileges, the older guys on the team had seniority so my husband often got the worst jobs.\nSo, my husband, now 16 or thereabouts, comes home stumbling drunk in the early hours of the morning, forgetting that he has work with his dad the next day and that they leave at 05:30.  He is so sick he spends some time retching violently into the toilet then collapses into bed.  His dad pulls his out of bed and says - 'get ready for work.  Work doesn't wait.'  Just as a side note, my FIL was no angel, and was a real party animal.  When it was work though, no matter how crap you feel, you give 100%.  No excuses.  \nSo, husband rinses his mouth, and stumbles out of the door after his dad wearing last night's clothes.  Even that early it was a burning hot day.  My FIL decides that this is the time to take the back (dirt) roads to the job site (a new warehouse being built).  Very bumpy road.  Slow down to a crawl so that you can feel every bump in the road, then speed up and ramp over the big bumps so that your stomach drops.  My husband still gets a bit green around the gills when he remembers it.  My FIL (LOL) was very solicitous and kept saying stuff like - 'Oh, I am sorry, are we feeling a bit fragile today?'  Speed up, WHOOMP.  Then he takes a warm beer from yesterday out of the cooler box, cracks it and waves it under my hubby's nose, cue my husband gagging.\nWhen they finally made it to the warehouse my FIL made him paint a yellow line that demarcated a huge portion of the warehouse for safety reasons.  No (whatever) past this point or something.  All he said was, I don't want one drop of yellow paint outside of that line.  If you have to stay here for days, you'll do it.  So, here's my poor husband, enveloped in paint and thinner fumes, hands shaking, trying not to paint free hand outside of this line that was probably half the warehouse's length.  He kept having to run and puke from the paint fumes now and again, but he got the job done, and his dad was a perfectionist.\nAfterwards his dad took him out for a greasy meal, they smoked a joint together, and he never drank to that extent before working with his dad again.  My hubby always says about that day - 'I just wanted to die.  Fuck I miss my dad.'

Most of the time, I dont even answer anymore, because whoever is doing it obviously gets some sort of rise out of it. But, anyway, the calls proceed to get later and later in the night.

Yesterday. \nI have a \"front\" door, which is actually towards the back of the building, in a fairly hard to get to hallway/alley. You can't see the ally way from the street, as it is guarded by tall bushes blocking out street views. I also have a sliding glass door that leads to a balcony over the front of my garage/driveway and a main road, and then..the pacific ocean / beach. Like, can't miss it. \nAnyway, it gets hot here, so I open up the front (back) door, and the sliding glass door, to get a good cross breeze. Im sitting on the couch yesterday, redditing away, just doing my own thing, when I see a dark figure standing in the door way with a cane in his hand. He sort of whistles to get my attention, and I jump up, thinking its probably someone i know, but just can't tell because of the lighting. \nAs I get closer, I see a sub-30 year old man, dressed in black cargo pants and a long sleeve black shirt with a black cane just sort of smiling / staring at me. So, I come at him, trying to recognize him in any way I can (nope) and he tells me he needs directions to the beach. Now, I'm a little thrown off because literally from any point on my street, you can see the beach. He proceeds to tell me he took the bus from (nearby) town and thought it might be a good day to go down to the beach. \nAll the while, I'm basically just searching for any quick directions to get him off my front porch, and the entire time he was just staring at me. Not like actually trying to remember the directions, or repeat them back or anything. Not like he actually needed directions, anyway. He then makes a comment about the necklace i had on, asking if my boyfriend had bought that for me. Smooth. I said \"no, my fianc\u00e9 did..\" and he just kinda said \"oh...\" and hobbled off my front porch. \nIt sounds ordinary, but its just not. If he actually DID take a bus into town, you would literally have to go out of your way from where the bus stop is to walk up to my place, and then ask for directions to the beck. Second of all, like I said, I live across the street from the most popular beach in our town and its quite obvious from the street. Third of all, yesterday was overcast and rainy (not a beach day) and he was covered head to toe. \nI just got the eerie feeling in the pit of my stomach that he was there for something else, but I guess ill never know.
