I also don't mind large fights lasting for 10-15 minutes because good PvP is just so damn rare. In the other fights and most of the time, the wings I am in usually do a very good job coordinating fire but this was not illustrative of that.\nI love the combat in this game. I love the drama.

{"url": ["https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUgo831-1DU"], "text": ["TL;DR: better in some ways, but worse in many others. Personally I'd prefer a VR headset.\nA VR environment gives you true immersive 3D including position tracking, so that you can move your head and see the world around you react naturally, for example leaning closer to an object lets you see it close up. That's essential to get the feeling of actually being somewhere as opposed to watching images on a screen. Movie-theater 3D isn't the same thing since it doesn't follow your head movements, so you get some depth effects but you'll never feel fully immersed.\nFor a screen-based setup like this without head position tracking, the picture only looks right when your head is placed in one specific spot, usually straight in front of the screen center at a distance that matches the configured field of view angle. Everywhere else will look distorted, and a mismatch can lead to motion sickness, especially when your peripheral vision doesn't move quite right.\nIf you were to add position tracked 3D shutter glasses to this setup, then you'd have a \n which is a true VR system. You'd be able to see the ship's interior floating in space in the right location, and view things from different angles, as long as the line of sight from your eye to the object still intersects the screen. (It's not a Hollywood hologram.)\nA CAVE system has several advantages over a VR headset such as the Oculus Rift or HTC Vive. You only need to wear lightweight shutter glasses instead of a heavy headset, and you can still see and interact with the real world inside the room. Downside is that this can be distracting if the real objects don't match your spaceship environment. Also, it's of course fairly expensive and bulky to set up and you need careful calibration to get a good experience.\nAs another point of comparison - one of the early Elite Dangerous betas had a bug where the Oculus Rift view was not stereoscopic, both eyes saw the exact same image. That made it look as if all the scenery was painted on a screen wrapped around you. Pretty much everyone found this unusable and was very glad when this was fixed quickly. But in a way that buggy view is exactly what you get in this setup which doesn't have head tracked 3D.\nSo in summary, you'll have a much better spaceship experience in a VR headset. But if you want to see your coffee cup you'll need to attach a position tracker to it (and drink carefully), and you'll only see your copilot if they are also wearing a headset."], "votes": ["7"], "type": ["COMMENT"], "hyperlink": ["https://www.reddit.com/r/EliteDangerous/comments/3pr60e/to_say_that_im_a_bit_envious_of_this_ed_setup/cw91v74"]}

The problem is, the further away something is, the less accuracy you can have. The galaxy is so ridiculously huge, that you can't use the same floating point system across \n of it, and still know exactly where you are in your local space. You end up jittering about in space and it's a mess.\nSo you need two independent coordinate systems, a galaxy position, and a star position, where the mantissa has lots of useful resolution (you could maybe get away with ints for this, but that makes other calculations a pain in the arse).\nOne way to allow SC from one star to another is to \n have star boundaries which, if you cross, switch you to the other star's coordinate system. You'd still have to load the data for that system somehow, but if you're that far out in space, FD might be able to do it in the background.
