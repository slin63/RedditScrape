The fact is that if you want to be a successful entrepreneur, you typically won't stay in the Chicago area (and certainly not in C-U).  \nMy understanding is that the University has a better philosophy than when we left in '94 but there obviously is still not the startup culture of the Bay Area, Boston, Austin, Seattle, Portland, NY, etc...  Frankly, this isn't something that can change overnight.  You need successful companies to grow up, spawn a next generation of investors and repeat - for multiple generations.  UIUC blew one big chance (as alluded to in that article) for that cycle to begin twenty years ago.  I hope they learned their lesson for their next chance.\nBut frankly one of the biggest factors is beyond the control of UIUC and that is location.  You are not going to get a community built up around UIUC like you do around Stanford, MIT, UT Austin, etc. because it is in the middle of nowhere.  Chicago being two hours away  doesn't even begin to count.   The students/startups and the money (or where the money \n want to live) need to be much closer to each other."], "type": ["COMMENT"]}

And you don't have to tell me about the diversity of Latin America, I've lived in south and central America. If you want to play the 'assume it's a US' comic' game, I'm going to play the Canadian border card. \nMy point is that undocumented immigration is a big social issue right now but more so in Europe than the U.S. I think it's ignorant to assume the comic is making fun of immigrating Mexicans, or Hispanics. By assuming that, one really only perpetuates the prejudiced connection that an undocumented immigrant is a Mexican. \nThe reality is that undocumented immigration, especially one of massive numbers, can indeed have negative effects on a country's infrastructure and economy. It isn't racist to try to reduce the number of illegal immigrants.\nWith it being a social issue right now as refugees from certain countries search for new homes while bypassing \"the system,\" I really don't see why it's inappropriate to depict in a cartoon - cartoons are generally a comedic social commentary, no? Would it be offensive to make a comic showing police brutality or government corruption? How about a comic that makes a joke out of minimum wage? \nPeople are reading much too far into this comic and jumping to the conclusion that it's racist. I think that's dumb. By trying to be PC, people are acting ignorant. "], "type": ["COMMENT"]}

There are no stupid questions on this subreddit. We exist to help people studying at or living in the vicinity of the University of Illinois. Please don't be dissuaded from asking similar questions in the future. Even trolls are helpful occasionally to sincere posters looking for help/advice/information\nCan we just take a step back and pretend that it wasn't you but someone else? OP came in asking \"how do I check out a library book?\" and got a hilariously straightforward response \"1. Go to library front desk 2.  Ask for the book you want\" and replied with fairly aggressive comments \"fuck you dude\" \"sarcastic...\" If it weren't you I was explaining this to you at a bar over beers I bought (by doing this I get to pressure people into laughing at my shitty jokes) you would probably be chuckling heartily"], "type": ["COMMENT"]}

There is \n some guy who is arrogant and thinks they're better than everyone else and gives some offhanded sarcastic reply.

It's not just the graph of things and their properties, it's also all the algorithms and quantities and other frameworks that allow you to manipulate that information and query it in a natural way.\nSome of my background is in traditional \u2014 i.e., dead-tree-based \u2014 reference book publishing, and I've been a lifelong random-data/trivia geek; the launch of Wolfram|Alpha took me back to (nerd alert) days I spent as a kid flipping through almanacs and encyclopedias, digging up all kinds of weird facts about the world. Yeah, sure, there's this 'Internet' thing now, but there was and is something unique about Wolfram|Alpha, just having this mass of wide-ranging data combined into one interconnected, interactive, evolving thing.

I do not represent any party (though I have offered to connect the recipient of your threat with pro bono counsel).  However, I am considering writing a post about the matter.\nWould you be willing to answer some questions about your threat?  I'm particularly interested in discussing the factual basis for your assertions, how you reconcile your position with Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, and your evaluation of risks in light of the Streisand Effect.\nIf you are willing to comment, I would be happy to hear anything you'd like to say.\nThank you,\nEdited to add:\nI've decided to write about this. If anyone has received a legal threat from Suburban Express and/or its attorney, I would be very interested in seeing the threat.

My /usr/share/dict/words has only 72k alphanumeric words, which gives about 2\n four-word passwords. To get the strength Wolfram calls \"very weak\" using normal Diceware, you'd need a nine- or ten-word password.\nOddly, Wolfram considers CorrectHorseBatteryStaple to be \"fair\" because it allows uppercase letters, despite it being no stronger than the other if you know the format of each, so their algorithm doesn't seem to be taking into account whether the password is based on a word list, although it does deduct points for there being at least one dictionary word.\nWolfram calls your password \"very strong\" if it's one out of 2\n (not sure what the cutoff is), which you can get with about 20 Diceware words or about sixteen from my laptop's dictionary. If you have a million words in your dictionary, you can get away with only thirteen words.\nEdit: I don't understand the algorithm. The query \"j0J7j#n^b password\" gives \"very strong\", despite estimating it as one out of only 2\n possible passwords of that format (much fewer than it estimates for correcthorsebatterystaple, which it calls \"very weak\"). Not sure what's up there, but it seems like Wolfram would, if they knew the format, consider a properly-generated five-word Diceware password to be \"very strong\"."], "type": ["COMMENT"]}

Good luck!\nJust clarification on the \"reopening the court cases\"...the motion I looked at, granted I did not look at all of them, is simply asking the court to enter a correct order for a clerical error on the previous court order...the attorney in the motion is not requesting that the case be opened and actively pursued again, again just the single PDF I looked at, they are merely asking for the court to enter an order of a voluntary dismissal, which is appropriate unless a settlement had been reached by both sides. The court is usually prone to granting any clerical issue remedies, more so if done within a 30 day timeframe. It appears the attorney who entered the order dismissed with prejudice, dwp, which is done at the conclusion of a case. A voluntary dismissal is done when a settlement has not been reached but the plaintiff decides to not pursue the case for whatever reason.\nIf someone has something in writing or the actual transcript of what was said in open court, the judge will probably grant the motions...then they have a year to refile the claim.

I expected that things would get nasty with anyone who has an interest in their businesses.\nWhat I did not expect, is that \"someone else\" would be the one trying to harrass and intimidate me.  Go figure.  As I do not know who this is, I am still prepared that this will get nastier, and I am prepared to deal with it just fine, don't you all worry!\nAnd also, since s/he posted my real birthdate, you all know how f*(#g old I really am now -- BUT also know, I'm not a 20something that will cave to anyone either - whoever it is!\nIf you notice, I speak about transportation, carriers, merchants, examples of transport operations, and geography.  This is all done without mentioning any particular name(s) that may get me sued.\nSince there are no grounds to sue me, as I did not buy a ticket, and I do not mention certain names, the approach being used on me is to intimidate me to shut up and not help any of you.\nBut see, here is the thing.  I KNOW that is the plan.  And knowing is half the battle.\nBut I WILL help you all! \nIn part, it is because my son would be graduating high school next month if he had lived.  He would be a freshman in the fall, and becoming friends with you, maybe even partiers or roommates, if he had lived.  \nI don't have the chance to help my own son anymore, and I'll never be able to teach him about traveling better, or how to protect oneself legally when things happen.\nSo, I'll help you.  Some of your parents may not be able to help you right now, and I dont have a son to help anymore, so let's just agree that I'll help watch out for you all!\nRemember also, we should not mention anyone's name without proof, ok?"], "type": ["COMMENT"]}
