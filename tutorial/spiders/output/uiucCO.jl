Good luck!\nJust clarification on the \"reopening the court cases\"...the motion I looked at, granted I did not look at all of them, is simply asking the court to enter a correct order for a clerical error on the previous court order...the attorney in the motion is not requesting that the case be opened and actively pursued again, again just the single PDF I looked at, they are merely asking for the court to enter an order of a voluntary dismissal, which is appropriate unless a settlement had been reached by both sides. The court is usually prone to granting any clerical issue remedies, more so if done within a 30 day timeframe. It appears the attorney who entered the order dismissed with prejudice, dwp, which is done at the conclusion of a case. A voluntary dismissal is done when a settlement has not been reached but the plaintiff decides to not pursue the case for whatever reason.\nIf someone has something in writing or the actual transcript of what was said in open court, the judge will probably grant the motions...then they have a year to refile the claim.

I expected that things would get nasty with anyone who has an interest in their businesses.\nWhat I did not expect, is that \"someone else\" would be the one trying to harrass and intimidate me.  Go figure.  As I do not know who this is, I am still prepared that this will get nastier, and I am prepared to deal with it just fine, don't you all worry!\nAnd also, since s/he posted my real birthdate, you all know how f*(#g old I really am now -- BUT also know, I'm not a 20something that will cave to anyone either - whoever it is!\nIf you notice, I speak about transportation, carriers, merchants, examples of transport operations, and geography.  This is all done without mentioning any particular name(s) that may get me sued.\nSince there are no grounds to sue me, as I did not buy a ticket, and I do not mention certain names, the approach being used on me is to intimidate me to shut up and not help any of you.\nBut see, here is the thing.  I KNOW that is the plan.  And knowing is half the battle.\nBut I WILL help you all! \nIn part, it is because my son would be graduating high school next month if he had lived.  He would be a freshman in the fall, and becoming friends with you, maybe even partiers or roommates, if he had lived.  \nI don't have the chance to help my own son anymore, and I'll never be able to teach him about traveling better, or how to protect oneself legally when things happen.\nSo, I'll help you.  Some of your parents may not be able to help you right now, and I dont have a son to help anymore, so let's just agree that I'll help watch out for you all!\nRemember also, we should not mention anyone's name without proof, ok?"], "type": ["COMMENT"]}
