I write about issues including free speech, legal threats designed to chill speech (\n), and the Streisand Effect.  In addition, I connected people on the internet with pro bono First Amendment counsel when they are threatened (\n).\nI write you today to request comment regarding the legal threats contained in your April 24, 2013 letter concerning your client Suburban Express, Ltd.  I do not represent any party (though I have offered to connect the recipient of your threat with pro bono counsel).  However, I am considering writing a post about the matter.\nWould you be willing to answer some questions about your threat?  I'm particularly interested in discussing the factual basis for your assertions, how you reconcile your position with Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, and your evaluation of risks in light of the Streisand Effect.\nIf you are willing to comment, I would be happy to hear anything you'd like to say.\nThank you,\nEdited to add:\nI've decided to write about this. If anyone has received a legal threat from Suburban Express and/or its attorney, I would be very interested in seeing the threat. If the threat is based on an online review, I'd be interested in seeing the online review.

Good luck!\nJust clarification on the \"reopening the court cases\"...the motion I looked at, granted I did not look at all of them, is simply asking the court to enter a correct order for a clerical error on the previous court order...the attorney in the motion is not requesting that the case be opened and actively pursued again, again just the single PDF I looked at, they are merely asking for the court to enter an order of a voluntary dismissal, which is appropriate unless a settlement had been reached by both sides. The court is usually prone to granting any clerical issue remedies, more so if done within a 30 day timeframe. It appears the attorney who entered the order dismissed with prejudice, dwp, which is done at the conclusion of a case. A voluntary dismissal is done when a settlement has not been reached but the plaintiff decides to not pursue the case for whatever reason.\nIf someone has something in writing or the actual transcript of what was said in open court, the judge will probably grant the motions...then they have a year to refile the claim.
