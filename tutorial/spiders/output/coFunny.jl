Going to school I was surrounded by lots of \"wanna-be rednecks\" arguing, not of girls or sports no, over Chevy vs. Ford vs. Dodge. I never really hung with that crowd but there was some overlap in friendship (due to people being family friends and stuff, you know). One of my better friends in that crowd was Ryan. Ryan never got caught up in the politics of these stupid things. Partially due to the fact that he drove a POS Honda, but mainly due to his different obsession. Ryan freaking LOVED tractors. He spent all of lunch talking about tractors. Old tractors, new tractors, John Deere, New Holland, it didn't matter. Ryan was just obsessed with them. Word around school was his dad didn't even pay him for his help around the farm because to Ryan, driving the tractors was all he needed.\nNow all through high-school Ryan kept with his obsession. Unfortunately, this impacted his school work. He's rather a bright kid, but when you spend the time you should be studying repairing old tractors, your grades take a hit. That was Ryan though. I never judged him for it. Him and I stopped hanging out our senior year. I was busy with my AP class and Ryan was busy with technical school, training to be a heavy-equipment mechanic of course. Before this spring, the last I saw of him he was at the top of the world. He had knocked up his high-school sweetheart, and the two of them were getting married right after graduation. He had a job at the New Holland plant lined up too. So after graduation I gave him one last pat on the back as I prepared to go to University and he prepared for his wedding. \nFlash forward 5 years to this past spring, I'm still at school due to working a year holding me back. After the semester ends I head back to good ol' Lancaster County. Hanging at the local bar in my town I look over and see Ryan sitting by himself at the end of the bar. I head on over and say hello, and he buys me beer so take it as an invitation to sit down. We start talking, he loved hearing about all my college stories but brushed off any of my attempts to talk about his life. I finally just straight up asked him about his job at New Holland. With a blank look in his eyes he told me he quit last October. Being the awkward kid I've always been I tried to play off the subject with a joke \"So that's why you aren't wearing any tractor t-shirts. I gotta say I hardly recognized you.\" My joke didn't work. Ryan started to tear up. He downed his beer and ordered another one as he began his story.\nThe September before this his wife, child, and him went to the local fair. Fairs in Lancaster County are different than many other counties. Instead of concerts or performances there are horse shows and pig catching contests. Instead of rides and games there are livestock shows and food contests. The highlight of the fair is always the Tractor Pull. People come from all over the state to pit their tractors against each other. So Ryan of course has front row seats to the tractor pull. He's been saving them all day. The event starts and Ryan is fixing all his attention on the tractors. He stares at the wheels noting anything of importance. He closes his eyes and listens to the roar of the engine. He barely registers that his wife gets up to get a funnel cake. Little Ryan Jr. has been taking after his dad very well. He loved tractors almost as much as his dad, but unfortunately his dad loved tractors too much. With his eyes fixated on the event he doesn't notice little Ryan climbing over the fence. The worst happens and a tractor veers of course headed right for the boy. Before the driver, Ryan or Ryan Jr. realized what was happening it was too late. Ryan Jr. was struck down, killing him instantly...\nRyan went on to tell me how the lost of his son split his marriage apart. Also he went on to talk about how he swore off tractors forever. He smashed up all his collectible model tractors, he threw out all his paintings of old John Deeres sitting in freshly harvested fields, he even sold his father's precious tractor that was gifted to him on his wedding day. He quit the New Holland plant and started working in a local car shop. \nSo I'm a rather sensitive guy, I'll admit it. I start to tear up and start coughing uncontrollably. Some things I haven't mentioned. I have asthma, and the bar was filled with smoke at this point. Some bikers had decided to come in and started fumigating the place about halfway through Ryan's story. As I was pulling myself together Ryan asks \"The smoke?\" to which I croaked out a yes. He dries his eyes with his jacket, downs his beer and says \"I got you.\" Before I had a chance to respond Ryan stands up, exhales a bit, and starts to inhale. Like he was taking a giant deep breath. He finishes, holds his breathe, and walks outside and exhales a thick cloud of smoke. He does this two more times until the bar is as clear as cold day in November. Finally being able to breathe I stood in shock at Ryan. I practically screamed \"What was that?\" to him and he just shrugged and said \"Well you see... I'm an ex-tractor fan.\" "], "type": ["COMMENT"]}

Those concessions were made in order to placate that one crybaby's sensitive personal beliefs.  \nThat single person was responsible for raising such a public stink about a specific episode (the one where Al and Steve went to the lingerie store in Wisconsin to buy Peggy a bra - the episode was titled \n) that numerous sponsors even dropped their support of the show to avoid the negative publicity her public bitching brought about.\nI can easily imagine that, due to the introduction of the Internet, a whiny parent like Terry Rakolta would be able to garner serious support amongst the SJW/HAES crowd today, and today a person like her could do far more damage to the show than she was able to do back in the late-1980s before the Internet.

But they're just laughing along making fun of everything he says and insulting him about everything. Someone please tell me it's all fake, that would make it a little better.
