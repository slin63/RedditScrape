I'm sorry I cannot tell you which ones.\nIn Australia, medicare will provide a rebate for up to 5 sessions with a Speech Pathologist, when referred by a GP with a CDM plan (formerly known as an EPC plan). At this point in time, Skype sessions are not covered but there is a large push to change this. As many Australians live in remote areas and cannot travel to the large cities in which allied health services are located, it's particularly important that Skype sessions become available under medicare.\nA recommendation would be to know your limits and not push yourself too far too quickly. I see many clients with vocal strain or vocal nodules as they have not known the most effective voice training methods and/or tried reaching levels their voices are not yet capable of.\nYes, definitely! I would recommend first achieving the sound/s in isolation that you have trouble with (the s and/or sh I presume). Use a mirror to achieve the correct tongue and lip placement on the single sound. When you can produce the sound in isolation, incorporate it in syllables, in word initial, word medial, and word final positions. E.g., se, so, su. esa, osa, usa. es, os, us.  Use as many combinations as you can. \nWhen you reach at least 90% accuracy, move to word level, again using the initial, medial and word final positions. E.g., say, see, saw. dresser, lesser, massive. lass, kiss, plus. \nKeep up this pattern through word combination level (2-3 words at a time), phrase level, sentence level, and conversational level (both reading out large paragraphs - less thinking as the words are in front of you, then holding conversation).\nEssentially, you're retraining your brain to produce the correct sound, so it's important to start small and work your way up. The same method of learning applies with voice feminization.\nThe best of luck to you!"], "type": ["COMMENT"]}

Skullgirls characters averaged around 1500 frames each, so we can likely do around 6-7 Incarnations for the frames of one Skullgirls character.\nAnimation frames aren't the only thing, though. Making RPG characters is much faster than making fighting game characters. In a fighting game, the design is baked into the art - each animation of a fighting game character has to be meticulously timed and posed before it's drawn. But with an RPG, the timing isn't as important, so the design/art iteration time is much faster.\nFor comparison, the 4 chararacters and all the monsters in the Indivisible prototype were about as much work as one Skullgirls character."], "type": ["COMMENT"]}

And you have time for Reddit?! Sorry, just messing with you. Good luck on finals!!\nI get asked this question a lot. Let me talk a bit about my path to this job; maybe that can help.\nIn law school, I only knew that I really wanted to be a trial lawyer. While I'm a decent writer, my background in acting/improv comedy made me think that my skills would be best put to use in live argument.\nSo after my 2L year, I applied to every public service job that offered time in court to their clerks. I was hired as a CLS (Certified Law Student) by the Clackamas County District Attorney's Office. I really loved the work, so when I graduated law school the next year, I focused my job search on prosecution. I was hired at the Multnomah County District Attorney's Office right after I passed the bar.\nNow: At this point you're probably wondering where the animal focus came from. After all, I did graduate from Lewis & Clark Law School (after transferring from Temple my 1L year), and they do have the world-renowned \n, and the prestigious \n, as well as dozens of animal-related classes available.\nIt may surprise you to hear that I took advantage of exactly none of that in law school. I love animals as a general principle, but I was pretty laser-focused on prosecution. I took classes in trial advocacy, victim's rights, advanced criminal law...stuff like that.\nGoing back to my professional career: As a DDA at Multnomah County, I got a huge variety of cases right off the bat. DUII's, minor assaults, criminal mischief, etc. And included in that mix were a number of animal abuse and neglect cases. Whenever those cases came up, they demanded significant attention. And for whatever reason, I ended up with a lot of these cases on my desk. In fact, my first trial that was covered in the media was \n.\nThrough handling a number of these cases, I was brought into contact with \n. The Criminal Justice Program has been supporting prosecutors on animal cruelty cases nation-wide for decades; they are a terrific resource on these cases. One of the ideas they had was to create this AC-DDA position. Ultimately, Oregon was chosen as the state to try first.\nWhen the AC-DDA position was announced, I had recently been named one of the Top Ten Animal Defenders by ALDF, and I was intrigued by the possibility of working all around the state on these difficult, rewarding cases. So I applied and was chosen by a panel of ODAA members.\nNow: How does that help you? I guess the best advice I can give is to work on your trial advocacy skills, and shoot for a position in criminal prosecution. As a prosecutor, you get to handle all kinds of cases, and inevitably there will be animal cruelty in the mix. There are also attorneys that work on victim's rights issues in animal cruelty cases, and ALDF (and other non-profits) do a lot of work on legislation and advocacy for animals, so those might be other avenues to look at.\nHopefully raising awareness of the successes that I've had in helping resource-strapped jurisdictions bring these cases to a strong close will influence other states to take this step. I know ALDF is hoping that my work will be seen as a pilot program for other states.\nThanks for the questions!"], "type": ["COMMENT"]}

I'm enrolled and enjoying the experience thoroughly!  \nI have a chemistry degree and have about 10yrs experience in the pharma industry.

Or if we find contradictory evidence we can use the new data to help refine our model.  Generally, for small molecules a reasonable model with decent predictive power can be achieved with sufficient effort. \nAs someone with less Systems Biology background, can you comment on how good current biological models are?  Can they currently be used as a means of generating a hypothesis, or are they too rudimentary at this point. i.e.  What percent of cellular or subcellular phenomenon are currently predicatable using Systems Biology models?  \nI also live in the NYC area, are there any live lectures or courses you would recommend to enhance the Systems Biology Coursera education?  \nOr maybe Open-Source volunteer groups that we could participate in to get some hands on experience with Systems Biology?  \nThanks!!"], "type": ["COMMENT"]}

For other more complex behaviors (e.g. cell migration), the range is from, lets say, very good to not good at all. But as with most models and model building endeavors, hypotheses can always be made based on simulations, and one learns quite a bit regardless of whether the hypothesis turned out true or not. Actually, I find I learn much more when simulations don't match experimental tests. \nSurprisingly I do not know of any, outside of those organized by academia. Perhaps, we need something like that, but of course something like that needs a champion to push it, with the time to push it!

Let me start with a few general definitions (\n)\n: Typically defined as the intentional, knowing, or reckless injuring of an animal. \"Injury\" is further defined as \"physical trauma, impairment of physical condition or substantial pain.\" There are also related abuse charges for torturing, maliciously/cruelly injuring or killing an animal, and sexually assaulting an animal.\n: Intentional, knowing, reckless, or criminally negligent failure to provide minimum care to an animal in a person's custody or control. Minimum care has a long definition with lots of examples, but is generally care \"sufficient to preserve the health and well-being of an animal.\"\nNow, in the criminal justice system (when police/courts/DAs get involved), the State has to prove cases of abuse/neglect \"beyond a reasonable doubt.\" The only way we can do that is by getting \n about what is going on.\nI would say that the most important thing for people who are witnessing animal cruelty to do is to be willing to stand up for the defenseless victims. Pay attention to everything you are seeing; document it as best you are able to. Once you have a suspicion that something is not right: Contact your local authorities. (Local police/animal control/animal services/humane society) If it's an emergency situation, don't hesitate to use 911 because it's \"just\" an animal victim.\nThen: Follow up. I can't tell you how often people think that being a witness just means making the first call to the police. You may have to testify, either in grand jury or in a trial.  Cases can easily be lost this way, because people are not willing to follow through on what they saw. Animals can be returned to their neglecters/abusers.\nSorry to be bleak about it. To be fair, most witnesses in most cases are willing to do the right thing. When neighbors/friends/family are involved, it gets difficult, and I sympathize with that. But following up is, in my opinion, one of the keystones of actually doing something about animal cruelty."], "type": ["COMMENT"]}

Timing, readability, human reaction time, and the ability to clearly communicate to the player what's going on are super important in making fighting games, and we got a lot of good practice from making Skullgirls.\nHoweeeeeeeever, don't forget that Indivisible is an RPG - not everyone plays fighting games, and some combination of those things is often the reason why they don't!  A lot of people enjoy the IDEA of a fighting game, that is, \"choose a character you like and do cool stuff\", but not the reality of a fighting game, in that practice is required to really be good at it.  That's IMO why beat-em-ups (\"belt scrollers\"?) are popular, too - they scratch the fighting-game-idea itch without necessarily having the skill ceiling.\nQuite a few people have asked about having tight-timing-based things in Indivisible; an even LARGER number of people have complained about the difficulty of the timing-based things already present in the prototype.  :^P  To put it in fighting game perspective: the window for blocking in the prototype is 30 frames, that is, characters will hold the block pose for 30f no matter if you run out of meter or release the button; enemy attacks take between 70f and 90f from when the screen border changes; and the targeted character flashes for 50f when enemy attacks begin.  In fighting game terms ALL OF THAT STUFF SOUNDS LIKE FOREVER!  To other people, though, it can be considered WAY too fast.  The boss's kick is intentionally just 15f, which sounds \"kinda slow\" in fighting game terms but is basically unreactable in the prototype.\nThere are already timing-based \n in the prototype even without explicit mechanics highlighting them - just-frame blocking spends much less meter because you aren't blocking for a while before being touched, timing your attacks and supers properly can greatly lessen the cooldown they cause, etc.  \nI am definitely planning to add benefits for twitch skill in the full game, like properly timed blocks reducing damage, or juggles/OTGs granting additional meter/giving back portions of your action bar. BUT!  Those would probably be learned or equipable (equippable?) as the game progresses and have associated downsides should you muck them up, like if you miss the just-frame block you take additional damage.  So if you choose to go for the really twitch-skill-heavy route then you gotta make sure you're on point!  :^)"], "type": ["COMMENT"]}

Three years ago in Oregon, animal neglect could only be classified as a misdemeanor. Now it can be a felony if certain qualifications are met, and with significant possible penalties.\nI think people's perceptions are shifting somewhat on animals, realizing that they are sentient beings capable of experiencing pain, stress, and fear. And that spurs the system into action against abusers/neglecters. One of the things that helps DAs in Oregon at least is that they can look to me on these cases; they don't have to worry about taking somebody off a rape/murder/DUII case to prosecute animal cruelty. It's one of the reasons I'm hopeful the position will spread to other states.\nI would love to see an animal abuse registry put into place, even if the registry was only available to people who sell/adopt animals out.

He's also known as Kevin Squeaks. When Whitey screwed, he tried to keep the rackets going. He went over to Somerville, hometown of the hitman in Killers, and the coke dealers beat the shit of him, gave a beer 'n' a beatin' as Billy Bulger used to say on St. Patrick's Day. \nThat aside, Squeaks is absolutely correct. Whitey would have never talked like that to Martorano. I said that in my column days before Two Weeks did. The first time Whitey ever met Johnny, he went to his bar on Columbus Ave. in the South End in 1972 and asked Johnny to get Howie Winter to intervene to save his life. The young, more numerous Mullens gang was looking to kill him, as they'd already killed Billy O'Sullivan. I go into all of this in my book, Hitman, but O'Sullivan had just opened an after hours joint in Uphams Corner and on opening night Johnny shot a guy in the head. O'Sullivan had to shut the place down. Therefore, Johnny owed O'Sullivan big time for wrecking his place. Billy O, as he was known, told Whitey, \"If anything happens to me, you can call in the chit with Johnny,\" which Whitey did. Johnny was not his underling. He was the senior partner in the gang, along with Howie Winter. Getting back to Black Mass, the whole scene about the peanuts is actually based on a guy named Nick Femia, a former Joe Barbosa associate who became a drug addict and went to work for Whitey. \nTo digress yet again, he was a major suspect in the Blackfriars Massacre on Summer St. in 1978 -- five people, including a Channel 7 reporter not named Howie Carr, murdered in a cash-and-cocaine ripoff. When Femia went to work for Whitey, Whitey had Zip Connolly, the FBI agent, write a 209 (an FBI report) saying Femia really didn't kill all those people at Blackfriars. Femia used to walk down to the McDonald's on Causeway St. across from the Garden and buy fries, which Whitey hated. One time, he actually grabbed the fries out of Femia's hands and began throwing them at the fat thug. A few weeks later he \"fired\" Femia from the gang, and dictated a new report to Zip: Femia \n involved in the Blackfriars Massacre after all. \nMartorano has been telling people, it's too bad Nicky didn't pull out a gun when Whitey grabbed his fries and shoot him, it would have saved us all a lot of trouble."], "type": ["COMMENT"]}

She was in the laundry room at the condos and her dog growled at another resident when he opened the door. He growled. She told him no  and that was it. The condos do not allow dogs but she has some sort of medical statement that he is her companion dog and not just a pet. If her dog was a dangerous dog and needed to be taken, why did they wait 2 months to do it? Almost sounds like somebody knew somebody and pulled some strings to harass or get them out of the condos. I don't know. It was a very terrible ordeal. And I feel was total harassment.  I know this is not animal cruelty but what about owner rights? I feel she should still file a complaint.

I wanted to say thank you for the movie Thirteen and kind of want to tell you a story about it, if that's okay. Because it's one of the most authentic depictions of what can go wrong in a child's life that I have ever seen. Ironically, I actually was 13 when this movie came out and I saw it for the first time and fell in love. I was going through the onset of mental health issues that would eventually shape into Borderline Personality Disorder and I related with the way Tracy felt, how she self-harms and how confused she is about everything she feels. The girl who showed it to me could have had the movie based on her. She was going through a turbulent divorce between her parents and being the only child, she had nobody to prop her up, so to speak. So she turned to almost all of these behaviours you see in the movie, particularly sex. But I remember talking to her about the movie in class one day and how good it was. I said I loved how spot on the script and acting was and how I felt like Tracy did a lot. And then my friend said to me, \"I think I love it because it gives me hope that things will be better in the end.\" Today, she is engaged to a guy she's been dating for 7 years, has travelled extensively and is happy and healthy. I'd just like to say thank you for that movie, because I think it could have been a different story for her if she hadn't had something to hold onto. \nMy question is, did you anticipate the controversy this movie would stir up and did you ever question whether certain things should be included for the sake of how people might receive it?"], "type": ["COMMENT"]}

I learned from How High - is that any project with a team / personalities.... hair, makeup, lunch lady, etc.  If everyone has respect for each other, it's all good.  Everyone on the set for How High was respectful.  We all went to bed looking forward to being on set the following morning.  From the lowest job to the director.  We had so much fun on set  during the day."], "type": ["COMMENT"]}

Since then we've acquired bank records which prove she \n to buy a house under her name, bought about $40k in physical gold and silver, and spent the rest of the money either on \n (up to $14k at a time), checks to her and her husband, a \n and her personal expenses (groceries, expensive salon treatments, etc). \nIn spite of this very clear evidence, the Lane county prosecutor says she will probably not press criminal charges. Her reason? My cousin's biological mother said they were given \"verbal permission\" to \"borrow\" as much money as they wanted (with no way of paying it back). My cousin, who is legally and mentally competent, of course says this is not the case. \nWho would give permission for someone to spend all their money and leave them destitute?\nNot only that, but despite being named the new trustee \n. They still live in the house that they bought with trust money. They never even told us which bank held the trust funds (I had to find that out myself). \nThis has been going on for nearly a year now.\nSo my questions are as follows:\nIs the justice system in Oregon merely a sham to make people inexperienced with it feel like the State of Oregon is \"doing something\" in order to justify its own existence? \nDoes the State of Oregon care more about parakeets than people whose brains they severely damaged and then subsequently refused to protect from financial crimes?

If it is different, they rewind their entire physics state back in time and apply the correction. Then they fast-forward the physics state back to the client's present time. \nSo the position of the ball that clients see is not where the server says it is, it's where the clients predict it will be by the time their input reaches the server. This is how the server is able to be completely authoritative and doesn't have to resolve anything - the clients are basically \"leading the shot\" without even knowing it. \nThe side-effect is clients predict other clients' vehicles too, which is where most players' perceptions of lag start to show. For example, they couldn't have predicted the other car was going to jump a split second before hitting the ball so they mis-predict a low hit instead of a high hit, which gets corrected shortly after.

It seems to me that the car is on the right, the truck is on the left, and the car just happens to be a little bit faster (about 5 km/h or so), so it'll end up passing the truck. There's a difference of intent here. In a situation (speed limit: 80km/h) where you're on the right at 75 and a guy's on the left at 70, do you just stay in your lane and, well, end up passing, or do you go to the left, end up behind the slower vehicle, and have necessarily to be stuck behind this oblivious vehicle?

Saves so much time navigating through text enabling you to manage huge projects easily.\n6) I was only going to do 5 but I'll also add the templates the app comes with, from managing projects down to simple shopping lists.

This has caused us to explore new approaches in order to address the new opportunities of a cloud anchored, cross device world (service connectivity, cross-platform authoring and execution, standards-based languages, cloud based deployment/management, and more).\nAn early stage of this work is the cross-platform JavaScript APIs available to developers in Office 2016, and we are actively working on dramatically extending that API set to be in line with the existing VBA/COM OM. The good news here is that the new APIs will work regardless of the Excel endpoint/device, which will mean that solutions will be much more universal than they are today. Once we\u2019ve broadened the API set, we\u2019ll start working through some of the tooling (a more modern editor than the VBE) and macro recording."], "type": ["COMMENT"]}

Currently back in college making a switch to infosec. I feel i can tap in to help with this a little.\nWhen i got into trucking i more or less was out of options, not necessarily opposed to the whole thing but did what i had to do. When i signed up it was 6 month contract, 2 weeks total training for the tests (including dot tests) and it was back to back. Month on the road training.\nAt first its pretty intimidating, but then you hotdog a while and the skills part get sharper. For almost everyone, backing will be the hardest to refine skill, but if you're going east you'll have plenty of hard holes to hit. That'll help.\nWhat will drive you out of the business will probably be the schedule or the experience first year. Management is really slave driving most places, and very poorly coordinated. You'll sit when you want to run, you'll run when you want to go home, you'll miss holidays, family events, and regular social life stuff. I'm an introvert, so i was less phased by this.\nThat being said, i was happiest running solo. Still am. I just listen to audiobooks, music, or xm when i had it.\nNow, what drives you out after a decade is when you've got all this experience and no one wants to give you more than than 50k a year. 60 if you don't need a work/life balance. Its the latter that drew me off in conjunction with the ceiling. You can toil with your own rig, but you're doing more work for the same pay at the end of the year.\nThe winters, management, experience cap, being out all the time, and getting married all kinda sealed it up for me. Some can do it, some like me listen when people say \"you're too smart to be out here\" and say good game haha.\nIts a lot of interesting experiences acquired over a slow rolling chunk of time, and if you make it over a million miles you've seen a lot of what's to see. You've also done a shit load of extra work unpaid just to keep moving, and missed a lot of things you might have had time to see if you weren't rolling.\nUltimately, if any of that sounds unbearable, you probably won't cut it, but I've intentionally made it seem bittersweet... Because it takes monumental patience.\nI've done otr for 3 companies, stuck to them because loyalty looks good, but also because i chose smaller carriers. They tend to be calmer and more personable. I've also done air freight, local and over the border. Currently doing usps contracting while in college.\nI've hauled everything that can fit in a reefer, van, drop/step, doubles, or triples. I stayed away from hazmat, oversize, and flatbed mostly on the idea of consistency. Hazmat is more risk but no extra pay, oversize relies on escorts (risk bigger, but pay higher), and flatbeds can break your back as well as the bank.\nThat's my two."], "type": ["COMMENT"]}

From what I could tell, your biological grandfather was Edward Raymond Maffie (b. 16 December 1929 in East Boston), as his name is given as Edward R. Maffie in the Boston city directories from the 1960s (wife at the time: Geraldine, occupation: policeman). According to the U.S. Social Security Applications and Claims index on Ancestry.com, his parents were named Peter Maffie and Carmela Baldassari (spelling may be incorrect, as this is a transcription from a handwritten record). A cursory search of the censuses doesn't turn up anything for your grandfather, which is a little unusual. Turning to the obituaries page of the Boston Globe for October 12, 1985, two days after your grandfather passed, turns up the following:\n\u201cEdward R. Maffie, 55, a Boston police officer, died Thursday at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in Boston after a long illness.\nBorn in Boston, Mr. Maffie lived in Quincy the past 13 years. He was a patrolman and had been with the Boston Police Department for 29 years.\nHe also leaves three brothers, Alphonse of Newton, Joseph of East Boston and Anthony Maffie of Melrose; three sisters, Mildred Guarenti of East Boston, Mary Gilbert of Marshfield and Rita Marroni of Reading; and three granddaughters.\nA funeral Mass will be said Tuesday at 10 a.m. in Star of the Sea Church, Quincy. Burial will be in Cedar Grove Cemetery, Dorchester.\u201d\nThis gives us a little more to work with. Searching for Alphonse turns up a 1916 birth record from Boston that lists his parents as Peter Maffie and Carmela Baldasaro, so we can verify the parents\u2019 names from Edward\u2019s Social Security Application. Looking around for a marriage record for Peter and Carmela, we can find a 1915 record from North Walpole, New Hampshire, for a Peter Maffei, son of Alfonso Maffei and Jennie Rubillo, and Carmilla Mildred Baldasaro, daughter of Rizierie Baldasaro and Rose Sano. \u201cMaffie\u201d must be an Americanized version of the Italian surname \u201cMaffei.\u201d Sure enough, searching for Peter, Carmilla, and Edward Maffei turns up a 1930 census image from Boston with their names (I can share this image with you, if you\u2019d like). The census is unfortunately vague on what Peter did for work, but the occupation code (7893) stands for \u201cLaborers \u2013 Public service.\u201d Both Peter and Carmilla were born in Italy according to the census. According to the census, Peter was born in Italy in 1892 (give or take a year) and came to the U.S. in 1897. Unfortunately, passenger lists didn\u2019t contain any information about place of last residence or destination then, so I can\u2019t figure out much more from that info alone. It appears that Carmilla often went her middle name; she\u2019s listed as Mildred in the Boston city directories, as well as on the 1920 census (which also lists an immigration year of 1897 for Peter). The 1965 Boston city directory lists Peter as alive, but the 1966 directory lists Mildred as being a widow; unfortunately, the Massachusetts death index doesn\u2019t turn up anything for Peter Maffie/Maffei around these years, although the Social Security Death Index lists a \u201cPeter Maffie\u201d who was born on October 6, 1891, died in October 1965, and had an SSN issued in Massachusetts. Peter might not have died in Massachusetts.\nNow to find out who Adolph\u2019s parents were. He died on September 25, 1988, according to the newspapers (I checked the Boston Globe again). From this info, the U.S. Social Security Death Index tells me that his birthdate was June 1, 1911, and that his SSN was issued in Massachusetts. Sure enough, he was born in Boston under the name \u201cAdolfo Maffei,\u201d and his parents\u2019 names are listed as Nicola Maffei and Aurora Moro, both born in Italy. Nicola was a shoemaker. The 1910 census states that he immigrated in 1906 (census information tends not to be very precise, so take dates like this with a grain of salt). Taking a two-year radius around 1906 turns up six or seven ship manifests from Ellis Island, but none of these Nicola Maffeis appear to be headed to Massachusetts (and I can\u2019t say for sure that any of them are or aren\u2019t Adolph\u2019s father).\nIt\u2019s possible that Peter and Nicola were related. A more extensive search could determine where in Italy each of them was from.\nEDIT: I just found Peter's World War I draft registration card. It says that in 1917 he was a teamster for the R.S. Brine Transportation Company at the India Wharf and that he was born on October 5, 1891, in \"Avellane, Italy.\" I think this might be referring to Avellino, in Campania."], "type": ["COMMENT"]}

But the \"CALCULATE\" indicator in the status bar can be overriden by significantly less important messages (e.g. \"Select destination and press ENTER or choose Paste\").\n(2) When the \"Find and Replace\" dialogue is displayed, the focus may be in either the \"Find what\" or \"Replace with\" field (depending on whether \"Find what\" is empty?).

If you are passionate enough, you'll be able to make it happen.\nLuckily there are more opportunities in video game development than ever before due to the explosion of the game industry that started when mobile games started becoming popular.  If you want, you could start right now making your own mobile game, there's some really good getting started guides.\nFirst I would decide what area of development you want to go into: Production, Software Engineering, Animation, 3D Modelling, 2D Concept art, UI/UX Creation, Audio, Music, Design, Marking, PR, Quality Assurance and there's probably other disciplines that I'm not remembering off the top of my head.\nRegardless of what area of game development you want to go into I would recommend finding getting started guides online, then try to get into a modding team.  If you can't find one to join, start up your own!  Unreal Engine 4 has a really good modding and game development community going, so you could start there or maybe check out Unity as well.  The engines do most of the hard work for you, so you can spend more time on the creative side of game development.\nHaving a completed project that you can show a potential employer is the #1 thing to have in your portfolio, even if it's a small mobile game that you made on your own or with a couple of friends.

They are (over)used for some types of information like types of energy. The simple bar type ones aren't good ways to present information. The other geometric variants are worse.\nEach variant has pseudo 3D effects options that add nothing and hinder comparison of data. They shouldn't be used by anyone, ever.\nThere is only one type, IIRC, that has confidence intervals/error bars. This should be available to add to a whole range of graphs, particularly scatter plots.\nHistographs. Bin sorting data is very useful. Unfortunately the algorithm for the x axis labels and bins is mind bogglingly bad. It picks and labels the bins bizarrely, with strings of digits that show zero comprehension of use of numbers and precision when conveying information. The bins should also be much more flexible and user defined. (see primer link)\nAnother actually useful graph type is the 3D surface plot. It only has only one colour scale available for data and it's unique. You would need to force feed LSD coated skittles to a bunch of chameleons, put them in a kaleidoscope and centrifuge them to get a multicoloured vomit covered mess that could compare with an Excel 3D surface plot!\nScatter plots are the main workhorse graph and they are mediocre. There's a great deal of formatting needed to create something presentable. Even then if you save one as a template it saves every title, axis scale, everything and not just the formatting. There's no way to create an extensible colour sequence/scheme for data series, new data gets the next auto generated one. This is an improvement on the days when monochromatic graphs were needed for journals and finding enough ways to format a black line to be differentiable was excruciating. (see above re error bars.) \nBack in the 486/P1 days there was a huge memory leak in there too. Probably still there but not noticeable now.\nIn short it sucks and has been that way for decades.

I want to ask a question that may seem insensitive or offensive but its honestly not.\nMy company had an agreement on its leases with the reservation to have a certain amount of Native workers per location. We had one work more than one day, ONE DAY. He quit after 4 days. We then went through a 8 month dry period with only 4 applicants, none of which showed up for work. They were repeatedly reached out to, when I would have been fired on the spot for no call no show if it were me. The job was reasonably easy (clean the rig until you have the experience to work major operations), and the entry pay was $27.00 an hour. (Also keep in mind these guys were treated no differently, our crew was international and of mixed ethnicity, no justifiable or even mentioned discrimination.) Yet I would routinely see 10-20 young men on street corners in the nearest city asking for handouts. \nGetting to my question. What is the primary reason these young men refused to work a good job that they were basically begged to take? Is there something wrong with the reservation's education system that it didn't properly prepare these young men to work in an integrated and professional setting with people from outside the reservation? Is it some social stigma that we were never able to grasp? (I thought maybe the fact that we were drilling for gas/oil was it, but our safety and environmental record was sterling. This particular rig has one of the better performance records in all of North America and we were repeatedly complimented by the Reservations inspectors on how good of a job we did.)\nAnd to follow up, what do you think needs to change in the culture of these reservations to better prepare its young people to integrate into typical American society and be successful? \nEdit: I wont name company or any specifics like that.

It's really a great way to celebrate your heritage and to help explain your history and experiences to others. Often times people are insensitive about something and don't mean to, they just don't understand, and I feel like things like this promote understanding. \nOkay, on to my question. In high school a good friend of mine and his sister was Choctaw. She would tell me the most fascinating stories that were part of her tradition. They were sort of a cross between a fable, tall tale, and a bedtime story. I understand they were part of an oral tradition of stories. I've always been fascinated by these... Does your tribe have such a thing?  I have often looked for books or scoured the Internet for things like this, and there is some out there, but it is hard to find. I was just wondering why more stuff like this isn't documented. I worry about it being lost to time. "], "type": ["COMMENT"]}
