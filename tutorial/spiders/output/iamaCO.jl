We actually have a lot of guys leave our youth system to get scholarships at american colleges so I'd say from that point of view you guys are fairly different.

That's also why the officials granted me interviews that directly dealt with the issues of economy, human rights and refugees. All this said, I think the government of Eritrea is opening up to letting more foreign journos is, which can only be a good thing."], "type": ["COMMENT"]}

This person figures out all the mechanics (how enemies work, weapons, health, everything) and writes it all down in a GDD (Game Design Doc) that the whole team works from for the rest of the project. This is the equivalent of the game's screenplay (compared to movies).\n2) Producer = The person pacing the game, how quickly things get done, putting the staff together, figuring out schedules, spending, etc. Keeping the machine running smoothly.\n3) Director = The visionary. Usually at WayForward we also design out own games, but the director role specifically is to guide everyone on the team and shape what they're doing (like a movie director). So the GDD might describe how an enemy works, and the programmer implements it, but it doesn't feel fun. The director tells them how to change it, what to add to it, what to cut, speed up, retool, etc. Essentially a game is a big lump of clay and the director is shaping it the entire time until everything looks and sounds and plays just right."], "type": ["COMMENT"]}

The best way to become a professional game developer is to MAKE GAMES. More specificaly, FINISH GAMES. Game Jams are EXCELLENT for both of those things. Participate in as many as you can, and the friendships you make from those will probably last into your career.\nAs far as advice within the jam, I've got a few tips:\n1) Think SMALL. Think about how much gameplay you could make in the time available, then cut it in half (or less). Don't bite off more than you can chew, which everyone does (especially when starting out).\n2) Make sure the 'moment-to-moment' gameplay is FUN and CLEAR. In Super Mario, this is running, jumping, not running into enemies, but trying to jump on them. It's whatever the 5 seconds of gameplay your player will do over and over is. Make sure that's fun, and you'll have a fun game. If it sucks, then no amount of story or polish will make your game enjoyable.\n3) If you're collaborating with others, feed on their excitement. If someone has an idea they're passionate about, try and use it (instead of shooting it down). The best games happen when everyone on the team is excited and motivated.\nGOOD LUCK!!!"], "type": ["COMMENT"]}

Because over the past 2 years especially I've started working on a LOT of hobby projects (in addition to my WayForward projects) and it's very easy to get overwhelmed and lose your motivation. Here's what I recommend:\n1) You can have 20 things going if you want, but the reality is you're only going to be ACTIVELY working on about 3 things (max) at a time. As long as you're keeping momentum on 2 or 3 things, don't be worried AT ALL that the other projects might have stalled. You're only human, you can't spin 20 plates at once.\n2) All progress is good progress. It's easy to lose motivation because something is taking a long time to finish. But as long as you're making SOME progres regularly, it'll get done. Focus on minor progress and feel good about that. Maybe you only tweaked the way a menu screen looks, and it took you 8 hours, and there's still 500 tasks remaining. But if you make progress like that 500 times, you'll eventually finish.\n3) Don't kill yourself. Work on your stuff late into the night, then take the next night off. Unless there's a specific deadline you need to hit, pace yourself. It's the only way to keep inspired and make good decisions. If you work on projects at a breakneck pace without taking a break once in a while, the results will be bad because you'll be drained (creatively and energy-wise). Allow yourself to stop and reset once in a while."], "type": ["COMMENT"]}

When I write, I usually do 3 or more passes: the first pass is JUST to get all the required scenes on paper. The dialog is usually rough, the jokes aren't funny, and the pacing is off. But it's like a sketch - all the arms and legs are there. Then after that, I'll do another pass or two to tighten everything up, make sure the pacing is good.

He's also known as Kevin Squeaks. When Whitey screwed, he tried to keep the rackets going. He went over to Somerville, hometown of the hitman in Killers, and the coke dealers beat the shit of him, gave a beer 'n' a beatin' as Billy Bulger used to say on St. Patrick's Day. \nThat aside, Squeaks is absolutely correct. Whitey would have never talked like that to Martorano. I said that in my column days before Two Weeks did. The first time Whitey ever met Johnny, he went to his bar on Columbus Ave. in the South End in 1972 and asked Johnny to get Howie Winter to intervene to save his life. The young, more numerous Mullens gang was looking to kill him, as they'd already killed Billy O'Sullivan. I go into all of this in my book, Hitman, but O'Sullivan had just opened an after hours joint in Uphams Corner and on opening night Johnny shot a guy in the head. O'Sullivan had to shut the place down. Therefore, Johnny owed O'Sullivan big time for wrecking his place. Billy O, as he was known, told Whitey, \"If anything happens to me, you can call in the chit with Johnny,\" which Whitey did. Johnny was not his underling. He was the senior partner in the gang, along with Howie Winter. Getting back to Black Mass, the whole scene about the peanuts is actually based on a guy named Nick Femia, a former Joe Barbosa associate who became a drug addict and went to work for Whitey. \nTo digress yet again, he was a major suspect in the Blackfriars Massacre on Summer St. in 1978 -- five people, including a Channel 7 reporter not named Howie Carr, murdered in a cash-and-cocaine ripoff. When Femia went to work for Whitey, Whitey had Zip Connolly, the FBI agent, write a 209 (an FBI report) saying Femia really didn't kill all those people at Blackfriars. Femia used to walk down to the McDonald's on Causeway St. across from the Garden and buy fries, which Whitey hated. One time, he actually grabbed the fries out of Femia's hands and began throwing them at the fat thug. A few weeks later he \"fired\" Femia from the gang, and dictated a new report to Zip: Femia \n involved in the Blackfriars Massacre after all. \nMartorano has been telling people, it's too bad Nicky didn't pull out a gun when Whitey grabbed his fries and shoot him, it would have saved us all a lot of trouble."], "type": ["COMMENT"]}

That would be a joke and be pointless to put in place. What if the rule were stronger, say \"no bill shall pass that has been previously considered\"? Well not only would you be blocking good bills that failed previously but who would get to decide whether the bill was similar enough to a previous bill that had passed?

The idea is that if you spend the majority of your time on the first two, you won't have to spend much time on the third one.\nThere are two main issues with that: Firstly, the school district doesn't necessarily see it that way, and if they do, they usually don't know how to \n. Most districts aren't exactly sure how to wield an SRO properly and don't care to take the time to learn. So they end up using the SRO as a security guard no matter how much the SRO himself bitches and moans about it (a problem I personally run into frequently).\nSecondly, a lot of SRO's are just sent into schools with no real training on how or what to do, so they do what they're trained to do: act like cops.

I can't think of anything really on the spot for witnessing something unethical at work so I'll give that one a bit of thought, I'm sure there's something. \nThank-you for the response "], "type": ["COMMENT"]}

There's a part of my that wants to get super excited and rate them a 10/10.

Here in Nevada, it's mostly just browns, but every time I go on a walk, I find some flowers in someone's yard that I fall in love with, or notice the paint job on a neighbor's house that I never noticed before.\nWhen I take them off, I don't feel like a \"prison\" as you described it, but I do excited to go outside, and put them back on again. You are right, the cost is high (I paid $480 for mine after taxes). Had I paid closer to $300 I would say very, very worth it but at $480, I would say, yes worth it as a luxury expense.

I discovered he was color blind 10 years ago when he was 6 when he tried to tell me which kid on the playground ifo our apartment had taken his gameboy. He kept saying they one in the gray shirt, but none of the kids was wearing gray. When I finally figured out which kid he was taking about, the kid was wearing a bright green shirt. He could identify every other color when i asked. \nI took him inside and pulled up a colorblind tests, the kind in the circles. He couldn't see most of them but some he could sorta see,  would see a 6 where an 8 was. Now sometimes my kids mess with me so I still wasn't sure. At the bottom of the test was a reverse colorblind one, only colorblind people could see what was inside the circles. I asked him if he could see that one and he said no. I was momentarily relieved. I said \"No? You can't see what it says?\" He said \"No mom,  it says NO\" When I looked underneith the circle it explained that colorblind people should see the word NO.\nWe spent the evening explaining how it was no big deal, he just couldn't be a fighter pilot but that plenty of people live just fine lives colorblind. But later that night I was alone in my bedroom and I burst into tears. I was quite shocked at how devastated I felt. Not that anything was wrong with him, but that there was this fundamental thing about how we literally see the world and I didn't share that with my son, could never share with him. My favorite color it's purple but my own son has no idea what it looks like, and I have no idea what it looks like to him. \nI never let him know how upsetting that day had been for me and that was the last time I cried about, though if I'm able to afford these next year I suspect I'll cry the first time he sees purple.

The GOP was in this up to their eye-balls, too. How do you think Billy got the first presidential debate in 2000 for UMass Boston when he was president of the college. Of course, a little of the luster was taken off the rose by the fact that if you looked out the window where the debate was held, you could see the cops digging up the bodies of Whitey's victims buried under the Neponset Bridge.

It was a pitch black night, on a secondary highway with no lights.  A car was parked in the oncoming lane after having been in an accident, so the reflects on the front were broken.  My friend was pulling out to pass the truck when the driver shut off every light on the truck.  From what he described it was one of the eeriest things he's ever seen, the truck had the typical array of lights that seemed the light up the night, then in an instant the truck was a nothing but a sound beside him.  He had no idea that form of communication was a thing, but wasn't about to question it.  He took the warning and pulled back on behind the truck.  A heart beat or two later they past this heap of smashed car.  This guy was my best man, a very close friend, and a father of two awesome and very precocious kids.

Sometimes by an order of magnitude. Parents have pole position when it comes to the responsibility of teaching their children how to be productive, respectful individuals. But that instruction, and the socialization necessary for it to stick, \n. Particularly and specifically elementary school. All kids undergo a proportion of their maturation at school. All kids learn some essential life lessons at school.\nThe lion's share of that learning will be at home, of course. Parents demonstrate positive behaviors and function as role models. That's where the foundation is set. But it's wrong to say that it isn't a school's job to deal with a child properly. Especially in the earlier, formative years, it should \n be a school's job to include behavioral learning in any curriculum (and as far as I know, almost all do this)."], "type": ["COMMENT"]}

And you'd have every right to step in the second one of them broke one the the MANY laws we have in this county.

I was there once and I believe I inadvertently stopped a purse snatching. I was walking towards the big main exit and there was an older woman standing with a purse. I was heading right towards her since she was in my path to the door. Well I guess the suspected robber was doing the same thing.  He got to the lady 1 second ahead of me and grabbed her purse - she then held on an spun around by that time I was 2 feet from them both and just sort of stopped - I almost grabbed the purse too just out of instint. And the guy mumbled something like - oh I thought you were someone else and he does an about face and starts walking off.  At first I was like - oh well nothing really happened maybe he was telling the truth - then I kept thinking - in what circumstance would you grab the purse of someone even if you know them. So I decided to follow the guy and try and report him to security or any employee. While following him it was clear he was scanning the people playing the slots for a unwatched purse/bag.  Then I saw him make eye contact with another shady looking dude who seemed to be doing the same thing. Eventally I just ran over to a roulette table and told the dealer who told the floor. The floor did call someone and later said the watched them leave on the cameras.  But neither the dealer or the floor seemed intersted in catching the guy. The dealer was especially rude. I'm not sure why. After the foor person left to make the call I asked if I should stick around - maybe to identify them if they caught them or just explain what I saw and the dealer who wasn't busy refused to talk to me. Eventually after a few \"Hello? are you ok? Can you hear me?\" he snapped at me and yelled at me about how he was too busy to deal with me and had to watch all of these tables since the floor was busy.  I figured I would have at least got a thanks for keeping out casino safe or maybe a buffett coupon, but I got nothing. It was a very odd experience.  This was at least 1.5yrs ago so maybe they just didn't know what to do... but it sure seemed like a case of - I don't want to get involved. Makes me worry about security in the casino. I also worry about security OUTSIDE the casino. I used to live in walking distance - but if I was going to be leaving the casino after dark I started driving there for fear of someone following me out the door.

It seems to me that the car is on the right, the truck is on the left, and the car just happens to be a little bit faster (about 5 km/h or so), so it'll end up passing the truck. There's a difference of intent here. In a situation (speed limit: 80km/h) where you're on the right at 75 and a guy's on the left at 70, do you just stay in your lane and, well, end up passing, or do you go to the left, end up behind the slower vehicle, and have necessarily to be stuck behind this oblivious vehicle?

For example, with coal expected to continue to be the world's go-to source for electricity for many decades to come, how can any country - for example India - realistically claim it will be able to reduce emissions without significant (and some would say unrealistic levels of) investment and cooperation from business? Perhaps a global price on carbon would help in this regard, but it's sounding like that's less and less likely.\nIn short, what good are emissions reduction targets without concrete plans for encouraging investment, and indeed ensuring investment, into energy efficiency and low-carbon sources of energy?"], "type": ["COMMENT"]}

As we're trying to win on some of the biggest issues of the day that must be won and fought on, we have to build a system and movement together, so we hope you'll help us do that by giving us ways that you do want to be in touch and pitch in with contacts to decisionmakers.

Let's say we employ a fleet of highly efficient zero emission vehicles, which will be hailed via a mobile app like Uber or Lyft. Those vehicles can be far more suited to the task at hand, so we will have very many small, highly efficient vehicles for single commuters, for pizza delivery, for package delivery, and so forth.  \nI am in line with Bill Gates' thinking: we can innovate out of many of our environmental problems.

Are countries, in your experience, more inclined to take upon themselves ambitious climate targets when there is such momentum? Would you have any shining examples of this phenomenon?\n2: During previous negotiations, there have been mentions of production-based versus consumption-based emissions accounting. Ultimately, it seems that this was never adopted. What was the main reason for going for production-based accounting, and are consumption-based accounts still on the table for future negotiations?\nAlso, thank you for the wonderful and inspiring speech at Chatham House last Monday.

My step Grandpa, the one who I grew up with, was a low level bookie for Rhode Island mobsters. He married my gma after my biological Grandpa died. He used to tell me stories about how they had paper that disolved immediately in water, and when the police raided them a metal brace would come down and secure the door so they could destroy the books before the cops broke in. He ended up fleeing to Texas(which is where my mom met my dad.. soo thanks Mafia!)after his step son was killed by the mafia for stealing money from them. They left the money with the body to show it was about principles. I found all this out after watching an \n (Edit: this is also incorrect. It was a local news broadcast in Cape Cod where I saw it. I could have sworn it was unsolved mysteries but my dad tells me I'm misremembering)... until that moment I had been kept in the dark about this part of my families history. This is when I first learned of my Grandfather, and Jazz Maffie as well. "], "type": ["COMMENT"]}

From what I could tell, your biological grandfather was Edward Raymond Maffie (b. 16 December 1929 in East Boston), as his name is given as Edward R. Maffie in the Boston city directories from the 1960s (wife at the time: Geraldine, occupation: policeman). According to the U.S. Social Security Applications and Claims index on Ancestry.com, his parents were named Peter Maffie and Carmela Baldassari (spelling may be incorrect, as this is a transcription from a handwritten record). A cursory search of the censuses doesn't turn up anything for your grandfather, which is a little unusual. Turning to the obituaries page of the Boston Globe for October 12, 1985, two days after your grandfather passed, turns up the following:\n\u201cEdward R. Maffie, 55, a Boston police officer, died Thursday at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in Boston after a long illness.\nBorn in Boston, Mr. Maffie lived in Quincy the past 13 years. He was a patrolman and had been with the Boston Police Department for 29 years.\nHe also leaves three brothers, Alphonse of Newton, Joseph of East Boston and Anthony Maffie of Melrose; three sisters, Mildred Guarenti of East Boston, Mary Gilbert of Marshfield and Rita Marroni of Reading; and three granddaughters.\nA funeral Mass will be said Tuesday at 10 a.m. in Star of the Sea Church, Quincy. Burial will be in Cedar Grove Cemetery, Dorchester.\u201d\nThis gives us a little more to work with. Searching for Alphonse turns up a 1916 birth record from Boston that lists his parents as Peter Maffie and Carmela Baldasaro, so we can verify the parents\u2019 names from Edward\u2019s Social Security Application. Looking around for a marriage record for Peter and Carmela, we can find a 1915 record from North Walpole, New Hampshire, for a Peter Maffei, son of Alfonso Maffei and Jennie Rubillo, and Carmilla Mildred Baldasaro, daughter of Rizierie Baldasaro and Rose Sano. \u201cMaffie\u201d must be an Americanized version of the Italian surname \u201cMaffei.\u201d Sure enough, searching for Peter, Carmilla, and Edward Maffei turns up a 1930 census image from Boston with their names (I can share this image with you, if you\u2019d like). The census is unfortunately vague on what Peter did for work, but the occupation code (7893) stands for \u201cLaborers \u2013 Public service.\u201d Both Peter and Carmilla were born in Italy according to the census. According to the census, Peter was born in Italy in 1892 (give or take a year) and came to the U.S. in 1897. Unfortunately, passenger lists didn\u2019t contain any information about place of last residence or destination then, so I can\u2019t figure out much more from that info alone. It appears that Carmilla often went her middle name; she\u2019s listed as Mildred in the Boston city directories, as well as on the 1920 census (which also lists an immigration year of 1897 for Peter). The 1965 Boston city directory lists Peter as alive, but the 1966 directory lists Mildred as being a widow; unfortunately, the Massachusetts death index doesn\u2019t turn up anything for Peter Maffie/Maffei around these years, although the Social Security Death Index lists a \u201cPeter Maffie\u201d who was born on October 6, 1891, died in October 1965, and had an SSN issued in Massachusetts. Peter might not have died in Massachusetts.\nNow to find out who Adolph\u2019s parents were. He died on September 25, 1988, according to the newspapers (I checked the Boston Globe again). From this info, the U.S. Social Security Death Index tells me that his birthdate was June 1, 1911, and that his SSN was issued in Massachusetts. Sure enough, he was born in Boston under the name \u201cAdolfo Maffei,\u201d and his parents\u2019 names are listed as Nicola Maffei and Aurora Moro, both born in Italy. Nicola was a shoemaker. The 1910 census states that he immigrated in 1906 (census information tends not to be very precise, so take dates like this with a grain of salt). Taking a two-year radius around 1906 turns up six or seven ship manifests from Ellis Island, but none of these Nicola Maffeis appear to be headed to Massachusetts (and I can\u2019t say for sure that any of them are or aren\u2019t Adolph\u2019s father).\nIt\u2019s possible that Peter and Nicola were related. A more extensive search could determine where in Italy each of them was from.\nEDIT: I just found Peter's World War I draft registration card. It says that in 1917 he was a teamster for the R.S. Brine Transportation Company at the India Wharf and that he was born on October 5, 1891, in \"Avellane, Italy.\" I think this might be referring to Avellino, in Campania."], "type": ["COMMENT"]}

That'll help.\nWhat will drive you out of the business will probably be the schedule or the experience first year. Management is really slave driving most places, and very poorly coordinated. You'll sit when you want to run, you'll run when you want to go home, you'll miss holidays, family events, and regular social life stuff. I'm an introvert, so i was less phased by this.\nThat being said, i was happiest running solo. Still am. I just listen to audiobooks, music, or xm when i had it.\nNow, what drives you out after a decade is when you've got all this experience and no one wants to give you more than than 50k a year. 60 if you don't need a work/life balance. Its the latter that drew me off in conjunction with the ceiling. You can toil with your own rig, but you're doing more work for the same pay at the end of the year.\nThe winters, management, experience cap, being out all the time, and getting married all kinda sealed it up for me. Some can do it, some like me listen when people say \"you're too smart to be out here\" and say good game haha.\nIts a lot of interesting experiences acquired over a slow rolling chunk of time, and if you make it over a million miles you've seen a lot of what's to see. You've also done a shit load of extra work unpaid just to keep moving, and missed a lot of things you might have had time to see if you weren't rolling.\nUltimately, if any of that sounds unbearable, you probably won't cut it, but I've intentionally made it seem bittersweet... Because it takes monumental patience.\nI've done otr for 3 companies, stuck to them because loyalty looks good, but also because i chose smaller carriers. They tend to be calmer and more personable. I've also done air freight, local and over the border. Currently doing usps contracting while in college.\nI've hauled everything that can fit in a reefer, van, drop/step, doubles, or triples. I stayed away from hazmat, oversize, and flatbed mostly on the idea of consistency. Hazmat is more risk but no extra pay, oversize relies on escorts (risk bigger, but pay higher), and flatbeds can break your back as well as the bank.\nThat's my two."], "type": ["COMMENT"]}

I was very good at it too, to the point where I was going to be certified as a MOUT instructor (until the deployments got in the way). The police department has also run a few departmental active shooter trainings, with force on force scenarios and drills in old, unused buildings. I'm pretty well versed on it.\nWell... even though I just said all that shit above here, I have very little training (well, zero really) on how to do all that crap \n. All of our drills and training are team or squad based. The same principles apply, theoretically, but I have no practical application on it.\nThere is a really well reviewed program called ALICE (\n) and they run a single-man active shooter response training program designed for SRO's or similar personnel. I'd really like to go someday, but it's very costly and the chance of the PD and school district ponying up are about zilcho, nada, negatory. A man can dream.\nI've requested that the police department do trainings at my school after hours, nothing major, just walkthroughs or quick drills so that officers are familiar with the layout, entrances and exits, and danger areas. But, the basic response to paraphrase is, \"Ain't nobody got time for dat.\"\nWhen I'm freaking the fuck out on the radio yelling for backup because I have a shooter on the upstairs floor on the north side near the stairwell I'd like to think that the responding officer has the slightest fucking clue \n. The reality is they probably don't. That's sad.\nWhile I'm on my soapbox, there was an SRO who got kicked the fuck out of one of the other middle schools some years back. He was a bit of a know-it-all prick, the kids liked him, but the adults did not. He wanted to modernize and standardize the district's safety plans to fall in line with FEMA and other federal guidelines. He spent months putting together massive, detailed maps, strategies, plans, drills, you name it. \nYou know what the district did with it? \n Then they ejected him because he was making too many waves, and spending too much time doing district safety stuff than paying attention to his assigned school. So that's kind of a bummer.\nThe PD doesn't even have a way \n. They don't have a key. Someone either has to open the door to let them in, or they bash it down, or they wait for the fire department to show up and open the knox box for them (which is only at the front door, so GG).\nCounty radio would put my broadcast on countywide emergency if a shooting occurred and everyone everywhere would hear everything I had to say."], "type": ["COMMENT"]}

Why do they seem to take such exception to being held accountable (ie, the FBI director's assertion that the phone-camera thing is 'causing' the increase in violent crime)?\nAre these issues having to do with training (ie, the 'us vs them' thing), or does the profession attract a certain 'type', or are there other contributing factors?  It just feels like we've strayed pretty far from 'Protect and Serve' as the ethos, you know?\nAny guesses?\nAgain, thank you for taking the time to do this, for doing your job well, AND for your thoughtful opinions.

If your concern is armed intruders then private armed security, or training certain teachers to carry concealed weapons, or having stronger security measures in place, are all options that could replace the SRO as a first responder.\nIf your concern is police-student relations, a strong police department community relations unit that visits schools frequently, or even daily, to conduct presentations or just hang out at lunch would accomplish basically the same thing.\nAlternatively, removing the SRO's from the school and assigning one single cop to the district admin to oversee the entire district, visiting schools regularly, is another excellent option.\nTLDR yes the program is redundant and could be dismantled and outsourced.

Hell, I'll sit on their desk and annoy them out if need be.\nIf that's not possible, I do a \"touch test.\" I'll put my hand on their shoulder, or possibly gently grab their upper arm and give them a firm command to leave. Gauge their reaction. If they flip the fuck out, well, you've got to react appropriately within the context, the goal being 1) they don't hurt others, 2) they don't hurt themselves, and 3) they don't hurt you. In that order.\nBeing substantially larger than just about every kid in my school (around 240 lbs in full gear), it's not tough to simply wrap the kid up in a hug or pin them on the wall until they calm down. But again, every situation is dynamic and requires a measured response, you just have to keep your \n straight and remember that these are kids.

I can honestly say that, no, the situation hasn't improved. Substance abuse, poverty, violence, corruption, and social issues continue to plague our people.

More and more natives are overcoming it as the generations go on, and are learning to function properly in mainstream society. The downside to this, however, is a loss of native language & culture. Because of the shame our people have felt, many have abandoned their culture. There are still many who work on keep it alive, but I believe that a balanced native person must be in touch with their spiritual side to maintain a kind of... wholeness.\nEdit: added more to the last sentence"], "type": ["COMMENT"]}

My /usr/share/dict/words has only 72k alphanumeric words, which gives about 2\n four-word passwords. To get the strength Wolfram calls \"very weak\" using normal Diceware, you'd need a nine- or ten-word password.\nOddly, Wolfram considers CorrectHorseBatteryStaple to be \"fair\" because it allows uppercase letters, despite it being no stronger than the other if you know the format of each, so their algorithm doesn't seem to be taking into account whether the password is based on a word list, although it does deduct points for there being at least one dictionary word.\nWolfram calls your password \"very strong\" if it's one out of 2\n (not sure what the cutoff is), which you can get with about 20 Diceware words or about sixteen from my laptop's dictionary. If you have a million words in your dictionary, you can get away with only thirteen words.\nEdit: I don't understand the algorithm. The query \"j0J7j#n^b password\" gives \"very strong\", despite estimating it as one out of only 2\n possible passwords of that format (much fewer than it estimates for correcthorsebatterystaple, which it calls \"very weak\"). Not sure what's up there, but it seems like Wolfram would, if they knew the format, consider a properly-generated five-word Diceware password to be \"very strong\"."], "type": ["COMMENT"]}

I want to ask a question that may seem insensitive or offensive but its honestly not.\nMy company had an agreement on its leases with the reservation to have a certain amount of Native workers per location. We had one work more than one day, ONE DAY. He quit after 4 days. We then went through a 8 month dry period with only 4 applicants, none of which showed up for work. They were repeatedly reached out to, when I would have been fired on the spot for no call no show if it were me. The job was reasonably easy (clean the rig until you have the experience to work major operations), and the entry pay was $27.00 an hour. (Also keep in mind these guys were treated no differently, our crew was international and of mixed ethnicity, no justifiable or even mentioned discrimination.) Yet I would routinely see 10-20 young men on street corners in the nearest city asking for handouts. \nGetting to my question. What is the primary reason these young men refused to work a good job that they were basically begged to take? Is there something wrong with the reservation's education system that it didn't properly prepare these young men to work in an integrated and professional setting with people from outside the reservation? Is it some social stigma that we were never able to grasp? (I thought maybe the fact that we were drilling for gas/oil was it, but our safety and environmental record was sterling. This particular rig has one of the better performance records in all of North America and we were repeatedly complimented by the Reservations inspectors on how good of a job we did.)\nAnd to follow up, what do you think needs to change in the culture of these reservations to better prepare its young people to integrate into typical American society and be successful? \nEdit: I wont name company or any specifics like that.

I am not Native American and I find museums such as this so fascinating and it was such a positive experience getting to learn of that tribe's culture. I just wanted to say I don't know if the Pueblo have anything similar in your neck of the woods, but if not you guys should consider building one. It's really a great way to celebrate your heritage and to help explain your history and experiences to others. Often times people are insensitive about something and don't mean to, they just don't understand, and I feel like things like this promote understanding. \nOkay, on to my question. In high school a good friend of mine and his sister was Choctaw. She would tell me the most fascinating stories that were part of her tradition. They were sort of a cross between a fable, tall tale, and a bedtime story. I understand they were part of an oral tradition of stories. I've always been fascinated by these... Does your tribe have such a thing?  I have often looked for books or scoured the Internet for things like this, and there is some out there, but it is hard to find. I was just wondering why more stuff like this isn't documented. I worry about it being lost to time. "], "type": ["COMMENT"]}
