Here's my story:\nI had a weremonitor called Apsong show up to my rather flourishing fortress. I was used to attacks by creatures of the night (I lost a craftsdwarf to the dreaded weretortoise Torvod in year one). I called everybody to the burrow, activated my marksdwarves and shut the gate.\nI thought I was prepared.\nI watched as Apsong tore apart my butcher, who had been caught out gathering wood by the rampaging beast. Acceptable losses.\nA small tear rolled down my cheek as the Puppy accompanying the Butcher is ripped apart. Still acceptable.\nI watch as the weremonitor wanders around, looking for something to fulfill his blood fury. My marksdwarves were sprinting up the various floors of my fortress. They were on floor two. Soon....\nThe next thing I know, the weremonitor soars over the wall, a moment that surely will burned into my dwarves minds for the rest of their lives. He lands in the middle of the burrow on which all of my dwarves were located...\nThe weremonitor tears through the crowd. First injury goes to the Weaver. He quickly falls, bruised. The Waxworker, feeling brave, leaps into the fight. He soon falls, and the weremonitor focuses back on to the Weaver, bruising the liver and pancreas.\nLuckily, my militia commander had been filling her flask on the surface when the attack occurred. Leaping into action, she strikes Apsong several times.\nI am mildly impressed by her combat skills, as she dodges the weremonitors blows left and right. All of a sudden, the Apsong strikes a dreadful blow to the commanders head, stunning her. She gets scratched. A death sentence....\nRecovering, the commander lands two blows with her steel mace. The enraged monitor charges the commander. She falls. Her back teeth are ripped out by the beast. The commander blocks the next few blows with her steel shield. She looks to be gaining momentum in this fight.\nThe weremonitor, sensing this, grabs the commander by her fourth finger. Flinging her around like a doll, the beast rips off the whole hand. The commander falls, in shock.\nThe weremonitor starts leaping from dwarf to dwarf. The Suturer is almost torn apart, but the mason leaps in, taking the majority of blows. The commander rises again, but is struck again. She falls to the ground.\nThe Mason proceeds to get beaten into a pulp. The commander rises, but is too injured to fight.\nNoticing the sunrise, the beast attempts to retreat. The commander mutters to herself.\nNow a human, the beast begins to be torn limb from limb by the mass of dwarves.\nA miner buries his pick into the humans foot, then, his arms, and finally his cheek. \nThe captain of the guard pushes the dwarves aside, many who are now shocked at The Minors viciousness. Walking calmly forward, the swordmaster strikes a blow at the atrocities heart, ending his rain of terror permanently.\nAftermath\nAlbum from the monitors perspective\nSo, this was pretty fun! Now I get to hunt down all the victims. Haven't decided what to do with them yet."], "title": ["TIL: Weremonitors can climb(jump?) over walls."], "type": ["THREAD"]}

It was founded in 157, in a seemingly peaceful area.  The neighbors were Elves, the lake that rested against the mountain stayed frozen for all but one week in the summer.   Trees grew many Urists high.  The towers and gatehouse of the fortress kissed the very sky itself. \nYet, war was nearly unknown.   Death was a dream, yet the Overseer had a vision, that grand catacombs would need to be built, for something was amiss about the idyllic landscape.   Titans attacked. WereBisons cursed some of the citizens, yet all was rebuffed.     Until The Green Turquoise, the local dwarven government breached the Caverns in 164, releasing  Squidfins the Plague of Mines upon the fortress. The towering wrinkled frog stalked the fortress, it's fire torching the citizens. \nThe Fortress crumbled under it's fire and might.  \nYet the Mountainhomes were not to give up on the landscape, while peaceful it was also the furthermost southern settlement and it bordered Goblin territory (although they never ventured north, the fortress was seen as the first and last warning if they should decide to invade).  So they sent a reclaim party.  It too was destroyed by the first plague.   They sent heros. They too crisped and crackled under Squidfins fire.   Reclaim after Reclaim, Hero after Hero Failed.  Until the 7 Dwarves of the Razor of Cusps attacked the beast, all but one of the party died, Squidfins lay bleeding and broken at his feet, by the time it had died it had kill over 150 dwarves, and an assortment of other creatures.\nAnd so Kurelstukos was brought back into the fold.\nMany years passed, and another beast from the depths emerged. This one so mild and unassuming it's name escapes me, the humble scribe of the fortress, but what is important about the beast is it's poisonous blood.  A blood of rot and ichor, a blood of death, a blood of Plagues.  12 Dwarves were infected and covered with the blood. 15 Dwarves rotted.  15 Dwarves fought to survive, enduring surgery after surgery, having bits of themselves sawed off, chopped off, removed, gutted, and ruined.    By the end of Second Plague, 15 dwarves were blind hulking masses of scar tissue, too ugly to be viewed.  Yet there was another, Doctor Aban, the Chief Medical dwarf, had decided to remove his shoes before the final surgery on the final victim, something he should have done with shoes on.  As the blood dripped off the table on to his feet, his toes begun to rot.  Then his feet.    By the end of the surgery, Doctor Aban was bedridden, rotting away. \nYet, he too was saved at the last moment but a team of surgeons put together by the Overseer. \nYears went by, the monstorous survivors of the Second Plague of Lionrazor were drafted, they were fearsome fighters, learning how to see with out eyes, they knew no fear. \nYet... They should.  They should have known fear.    \nUstxu Phantombeaches the Wasted One emerged from the depths below the world.  A giant one-eyed beast resembling a massive emaciated turkey appeared.   It left a trail of poisonous dust.   \nThe dwarves, the survivors of the First and Second Plagues, scoffed at this beast, after all, they had rotted, they burned, they had rebuilt, they are Lionrazor, they are Death, they are the Defenders of the realm.     \nThey met the beast on it's own terms in the depths of the world, It killed two of their number.  Then another.  But the Dwarves fought back.  It's deadly dust choking the air, as it was cleaved to bits by the weaponmasters of Lionrazor, no small number survivors of the Second Plague. \nThey never should have been so glib.   While Squidfins burned. And the Second Plague rotted, this did something worse.  It rotted, yes, but it also caused massive swelling.

I dig through all the way down to the candy, open up the circus, hear horrifying screams from below, etc.\nI take a look at all the assembled clowns I can see. A little over one hundred and fifty. So all right, my five dwarf melee militia and trio of marksdwarves will be overwhelmed. \nI do have a trick up my sleeve, though. An artifact hatch cover, and an artifact door. Lame, cheap, things. Still, if they are indestructible, as they are artifacts, my plan was to lure up the clowns. Once a few pass the hatch cover, I forbid the door from use. If there's still too many I let some pass through the doors, then lock that, in hopes of further minimizing what my squad will have to face.\nAll that's left is for them to come. So I wait. And I wait. And I wait. And I wait.\nAnd I wait.\nNothing at all. It's been a few days and nothing. Even more curious, I don't see any more demons. They may have moved into the unexplored areas of the circus. Due to curiosity and impatience, I use dfhack to reveal the rest of the area.\nThey're still there, and then I notice one other silly thing. Nearly damn all of them are either made of ash, snow, salt, and steam. I'm like... huh. Most of them have poisonous stings or bites. One of the two steam creatures spews webs, and there's only three of them. I mean, web spewing will be pretty darn dangerous from what I've read, but all in all these guys look like misfits.
