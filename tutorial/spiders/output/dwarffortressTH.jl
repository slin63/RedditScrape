I could also probably learn a lot just from exploring other people's stuff.\nSo, is there a place with stuff like this?

I found that its filters were pretty lacking, and was really annoyed that I had to manually scroll the window to see new announcements. Looking into it, the program was written 2+ years ago and it seems the author has abandoned the project. \nSo I decided to write my own program that fixed those issues. I'm pretty happy with what I came up with, and I think i've ironed out most of the bugs so i've decided to share it with you. \nGithub link: \nhttps://github.com/NuAoA/AnnouncementWindow\nScreenshots: \nhttp://i.imgur.com/aNx8dl2.png\nIts written in python (2.7.10) and will give you a live feed of your announcements and combat reports, so you don't need to pause the game anymore. Its similar the soundsense console, but you can hide different types of announcements and change the font/color. There are two windows you can configure filters for, allowing you to separate important announcements from the never ending combat reports (or the less important stuff: \"\nUrist mcHauler cancels Store Item in Stockpile: Item inaccessible.\n\"). The filters that it matches are loaded from a text file and can be edited however you want, as long as you have a basic understanding of regular expression syntax.\nI compiled a .exe for windows that you can find \nhere\n. If you are on OS X or Linux you will need python2 to run this program, and I have not tested it on those systems yet, but I suspect it should run just fine. Please let me know how it works if you are on either of those systems."], "title": ["I wrote a program that filters announcements to another window. Let me know what you think!"], "type": ["THREAD"]}
