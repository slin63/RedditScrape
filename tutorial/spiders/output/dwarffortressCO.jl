Providing the range is built correctly (which sounds like you have - just make sure there is a WALKABLE path to the target to fire along) and your dwarves have adequate ammo and quivers, your squad will eventually use the archery range. 2. Change their orders. Instead of having a minimum train 10 order for each month, change it to multiple minimum train 1 orders, where the amount is equal to the amount of soldiers in the marksdwarf squad. I.E a squad of 5 marksdwarves would have 5 'train 1 minimum' orders every month. "], "type": ["COMMENT"]}
