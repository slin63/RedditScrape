I'm still learning python myself, and this is actually my first attempt at using a GUI library (tkinter).\nBasically, DF outputs all announcements to a file called \n, it's how programs like soundsense determine what sounds to make. One every second this program will check if that file has any new announcements written to it. If new announcements are found, it will check each one against the regular expressions defined in \n, and return whatever tags you used to define that RE. \nThat information is passed to each window (top/bottom) and if the tags are set to be shown for that window, it will insert the announcement into a tkinter.Text object with the appropriate tkinter text tags (they define color, font, etc). This will make that announcement show up on the display with the appropriate color. Hiding the [][]-tag text and removing tag types after they have been displayed is done with liberal use of the elide option. Note, the tkinter.Text objects are the majority of the displays, usually they are used for text editing but I disabled that to make a sort of console.   \nIf you want to follow this process in the code, I would start by looking at the get_announcements() function in the class main_gui() in the 'Window.py' module.

The former will require exporting that data into a format that I can input into python 3 to pickle, every time I make an adjustment. The latter basically requires the same amount of work, but I'll have to generate python code instead. \nThe third (and easiest) option would be to just generate that file the first time its launched, with the default settings for new filters -> white text and visible. Maybe i'll do that, just modify the code so that it looks for a different file if you are running python 3, and since the file won't exist, all the settings will be the same.

ASCII is meant to be easy to discern at small sizes. Trying to figure out what a graphical tile is getting at is frustrating. Squinting to see what everything is. Bah! When you are old like me just seeing the games are hard! Give it to me clean!\nI turn the graphics down in all the games I play anymore because of my dumb eyes. Starcraft II, gotta turn off all the gee whiz stuff or I get lost. Skyrim too. :-(\nOther than that, ASCII engages the imagination in a much more in depth way. Like reading a book instead of watching a movie.\nThe ASCII is much clearer but maybe it has a learning curve for some? Growing up with Hack and Nethack I'm not fazed by ASCII at all. The learning curve was crossed decades ago. \nI think it can be a turn off for younger players, or players that never played an ASCII game or an old school symbol based wargame. You are interfacing with the game in a different way, you are imagining what is there.\nNot dissing the tilesets at all. It is all fine work. It's really tough to make something look right at such a small size. For some the ASCII is better. Neither is superior in and of itself. "], "type": ["COMMENT"]}

Completely bypassing all the traps and heavily armored axe and hammerdwarfs waiting for him. \nMy plans are in ruin.

Death and infection awaits and with it the destruction of my first fort...\n...\nNo need to worry. The flimsy unarmored ranged squad with no melee skills completely curbstomped him. From an unholy terror of destruction and doom to a sad broken heap on the floor in two seconds. He never even laid a single hand on them.\nWhen I saw this tiny circle of dwarfs surrounding this now sad and bleeding werebeast, rhythmically pummeling it to death with the butts of cheap second rate crossbows I felt pride and what can only be described as a warm glow descend over me.

You can also create a 'generational' fort by setting the first value low and the second value high.

Put down a meeting hall in an airlock, sift through the dwarfs and recruit the dead-weight into a squad.

First is just keep them locked out of the main fort, and have a meeting area in a place where you can kill them easily (drop the ceiling on them or drop the floor down a few levels). Second, you could use a burrow to temporarily quarantine the old dwarves while you handle sorting out the new ones, and only allow the ones with useful skills to join the old dwarves.

Make sure you have 2 minecarts for every magma powered building you want, place a dump zone on a tile the magma will flood and dump all your magma safe minecarts to it.  Once they are all on the tile, flood it using the floodgates.  Let them sit until all are full.  Then cycle the floodgates to empty the tile.

Channel out the wall, let the 2 tiles (channeled-tile and minecart-tile) fill with magma.  When full, use a pond zone and 2 buckets to drop water on the two tiles from 2+ levels up.

And remember, if you're going to play with fire you should always enable FIREIMMUNE or FIREIMMUNE_SUPER.\nAnd, as a habit, if you're doing any editing of the raws, make a backup so you can restore the game to default (or a working modded version) in the case that every world with a vampire is consumed in flames by the year 5.\nWelcome to the wonderful world of DF modding!
