If someone's already done it, there's no reason to reinvent the wheel and it's not comparable to plagiarism to do it, so don't worry about learning and borrowing from others' work. \nAlright, suggestions/critiques, chronologically:\n1) It looks like your code is indented with 8 spaces instead of 4 (though no tab characters so that's good), ultimately this is a style thing and shouldn't be a big consideration, but beyond 4 being the recommended tab size, I personally just think 8 takes up too many columns of horizontal space and doesn't give much in return. \n2) Since you used a recursive factorial implementation, there's no point in having it inside a while loop, as it will only get executed once. Recursion can be a hard to grasp concept for newer programmers, but I'm quite certain your code will function the same if you just simply took out the while loop and left what was inside it.\n3) \"!=\" versus \"not ==\", the recommended way of comparing things as \"not equal\" is \"not ==\", rather than \"!=\", again this is kind of a style/preference thing, but \"not ==\" looks more english and readable to me than \"!=\". In your case, your while condition would be written as \"while not intro_option == 'q':\"\n4) The reason your program is printing 'none' because of the line: \ninput() is a builtin function that expects a value that will be printed to the console, designed to be used as a prompt for the input value. What you are passing to it is the return value of another builtin function, print(), which returns None. What you really mean to do here is this:\n5) Another style thing to mention, would be to break up your \"both\" and \"row\" if blocks into separate functions that are called from those if blocks to handle their individual tasks. This would organize your code more and break it up into clearly defined sections that are easier to read and follow. \n6) Consistency of naming conventions, above all else, it's best to stick with one style of naming your methods and variables. You stuck with one style (underscored variable names), but you have some inconsistencies as far as some variables using shortened words like num versus number, fact versus factorial, etc. If you use \"num\", use it for the word number entirely, but switching back and forth kind of throws me for a loop. I personally prefer using the complete words, because it makes it look just a little bit more like english to me and that makes it easier on my brain to look at code I or other people have written and i'm not familiar with.\n7) Lastly, i'm not sure what the point of the \"elif intro_option == \"p\"\" block is, seeing as it does the exact same thing as the else, couldn't you just get rid of this?"], "type": ["COMMENT"]}

Anyone who could build something like this from scratch would be Senior level in my book.\nIt's tricky to really define Senior level because it's often much more circumstantial. Many times it becomes more of an architect role where these devs know the ins and outs of lots of different technologies. Their job is to figure out how these different technologies should all be interweaved and modified to fit certain business needs.\nI hope this helps, if someone with more experience wants to comment I would be very interested to hear other peoples thoughts."], "type": ["COMMENT"]}

However, you've misinterpreted what this does:\nYou think it means, if the player picked the location grid[b][c] (thus, you're treating this as a coordinate).  The fact is, grid[b][c] looks up the contents of row b and column c.\nFor example\nLet's say the user picked row 1, column 0.  Then, grid[0][1] looks up the value of D (which is in row 1 and column 0).  Notice that D contains no information about the row and column its in.  It's like asking which student is sitting in row 1, column 3.  Let's say the answer is Bob.  With Bob, you have no knowledge of what row and column Bob is in.\nNow, I put letters in this grid to make it easier to distinguish it, but initially, you probably have nothing in the grid, so it might look something like:\nI am using dots to representing nothing so you can see it easier.\nOnce a user has made a move, you need to record this fact.  Let's say,\nHere, you put the letter (or string) X into row b, column c.  If the row is 0 and the column is 1, then you have:\nNow you wrote:\ncomputermove != grid[b][c]\nwhich signifies an intent that the computer not pick this location.  However, that's a bit too sophisticated for Python (or any programming language to understand).  The way you avoid the computer from selecting that position is to do something like\nif grid[b][c] != 'X':\nYou determine what move you want the computer to make.  It looks at the grid to see if there's an X there.\nThis approach is flawed because the computer could have already picked that spot.  So it's useful, before the game starts, to put, say, a dot or a blank in each of the grid spots, and then check for\nif grid[b][c] != '.':\nYou check if there's not a dot at that location, and if so, don't pick it.\nHope this is somewhat helpful.  You've made a common mistake of thinking a programming language can record long-term intent (don't move to that spot) by using !=.  != (which is not equal) is something the program does at the time that line of code is run.  It can't record long-term intent.  However, you can put information into the grid and look it up later, so that's possible."], "type": ["COMMENT"]}
