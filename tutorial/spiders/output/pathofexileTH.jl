We will cover all that you need to know to get started with the game and avoid any big mistakes.\nThe Basics\nA really good overview of the game and it's mechanics can be found in our subreddit's \nFAQ\n. Reading Sections 1 and 2 of the guide will give you a quick overview of how the game works. It can be found anytime on the right hand side of the subreddit, right below where it says \"Welcome to the Path of Exile subreddit\".\nIf you prefer an amazing forum post over on the official forums with great illustrations and exmaple, you check out \n/u/noperative\n 's guide \nhere\n.\nOne of the community members / moderators here has a great video playlist over on YouTube with a full range of beginner guides. If you would prefer to watch videos over reading, head on over to \nZiggyD's PoE Beginner Mechanics Guide\n. This is the first video on a playlist of guides that covers all facets of the game: making an effective build, guides on fast leveling, what items to pick up and use (and NOT use), etc.\nOne of the hardest things besides building a character that can make it to maps / do well in maps is item management. Thanks to \n/u/McLeige\n , now you will have a slightly easier time telling what's worth keeping by referring to his handy guide: \nIts Worth Keeping if... [v1.1][All Leagues][Item Guide]\n.\nBuilds\nThe following guides are some of the tried-and-true PoE builds. These builds usually rely on self-found gear and gems that are available as quest rewards. Each link will take you to a forum page where the guides are located. They sometimes include a video which will let you see what you are working towards / what kind of play style the character has:\nWith the new patch, these builds might change to accommodate nerfs / buffs to the passive tree. Builds in\n \nbold\n \nhave been updated for patch 1.1.\nThe Ground Slam Marauder\n \nTanky LA BM Ranger\n \n(outdated, use at your own risk)\nEK Mana Shield Scion/Shadow\nEB/MoM/AA Spectral Throw Scion\n3 cheap builds by /u/noicreC (click the picture for links to the builds)\nRathik's Newbie Friendly \"The Matriarch\" Summoning Witch\nSovyn's Lazy Pally - Tanky Templar with Max Block\nTri Ele Trapper\n \n(outdated, use at your own risk)\nCold Witch for Beginners\nFreezing Pulse/Life Based Witch (Noob friendly/HC viable)\n \n(outdated, use at your own risk)\nOfficial Blender Build\nDual Searing Bond Templar\nOos' Crit Dagger Capped Block Ranger\nFite's Detonate Dead Scion/Templar\nDisciplus' 2H ST Mace Marauder\nFireball Witch guide for beginners\nIncinerate EB-MoM Witch\nResources\nLastly, here is a short list of websites and a quick note on why they might be helpful to you:\nList of Passive Tree Changes from 1.0.6 to 1.1\n: post on what changes have been made to the skill tree and commentary on these changes\n1.1 Patch Notes\n: 1.1 full patch notes\nSacrifice of the Vaal Forum Announcement\n: forum announcement of the new patch (not actual patch notes)\nPoE Wiki\n: contains a wealth of information. Use it to look up unique items, what keystones do, how quality effects each gem, etc.\nPoE Wiki's own FAQ\n: a great compilation of questions and answers about the different facets of the game\nQuest Rewards\n: this page of the PoE wiki shows all the quest rewards for each class and is a huge help in build planning\nPoe.xyz.is\n: this website / tool indexes forum shops and can help you find upgrades to your current gear\nPoe Markets\n: popular alternative to poe.xyz.is\nPoE Skill Tree\n: this tool let's you plan out your skills on the website and you can link it when asking for build help\nPoE Builder\n: a fully featured character planner, with a statistic summary, item creation, dps calculation, and character importing\nPath of Poe Skill Tree Parser\n: this tool lets you paste in the URL of a build from the skill tree and gives you a great overview of it's stats (%increased life, +strength, +int, etc.)\nProcurement\n: this tool that let's you easily setup your own shop on the forums\nMap Resource Management\n: full info on what to expect when mapping, description of all maps with signature mobs, bosses, and desirable mods when rolling\nCrafting Resource Guide\n: everything you need to know before you start crafting\nPoE Offline Skill Tree Calculator\n: offline skill tree which adds up your passive bonuses\nPoE Skill Tree App for Android Phones\n: Great skill tree app for android.

That being said, first character tend to struggle. If you would like to ask assistance please make you include the following:\nYour passive tree: this can be acquired by going to the official website, click your character portrait (once you are logged in), selecting your character, selecting \"passive tree\" tab on the left side of your character's inventory screen. Copy + paste the link here so we can see what passives you have taken.\nCreate a forum post of your character and post your potions + gear. To do this, go to your character's forum and create a new topic. Once have the new topic window open, click your character screen and simply click each piece of gear you want to link the forum. Once done, close your character screen and you should have links to your character's gear in a forum post (hit preview and see if you did it right). \nA screenshot or write up of your main skills + defense tab.\nIf you have made a reasonable attempt (ie.: read through this collection of links, searched the subreddit, did a google search) and you still have a question, please post below and try to be as specific as you can be.\nYou can also try asking for help in game in the reddit global channel. Enter the following in the chatbox to get to it: /global 5055\nThanks\nThanks to \n/u/incognegrodamus\n for additional resources and build suggestion and to \n/u/noicreC\n for additional builds.
