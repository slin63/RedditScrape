These are mostly relevant in larger forts, though. Limit the number of grazers (same reasoning as limiting dwarves.) You can also turn off invasions if you don't mind the loss of fun.\nThere's been a lot of discussion about pathing optimizations around ramps, stairs, open layout vs. closed layout, etc. I'm not sure that anything definite has been discovered, but definitely place stockpiles and workshops near each other to limit path distance.\nHope that helps!"], "type": ["COMMENT"]}

I stopped getting traders, and just got goblins. There were 40ish goblins last time. I installed a flush system, which goes from the aquifer into an atom smasher, because at this point I don't much care for haunting my poor dwarves, and hardly care about goblinite. \nSeriously, was that last siege I saw the fifth, or the sixth, siege in two years? It is a routine, at this point: dwarves get called inside, brute squad to the trade depot, prepare to man the stabbing levers. The goblins trigger traps, they mill about the murder pit, and then I start flooding them in, water rushing in from the side of the entrance and pushing them towards the constantly-stabbing spikes and the masterwork traps of guillotinesque efficiency.\nNot a single goblin has made it so far as the far side of that pit, which is just as well for them because there are more exceptional (and exceptionally valuable) weapon traps around every corner. Still, the sight of so much murder and death is distressing to my dwarves, and in their impregnable, and resplendent, home, they have taken to philosophize about the cruelty of caring so little for the well-being of such creatures. I think if any dwarf had died to a goblin lash since these defenses were operational they would be far less troubled by the task of throwing goblin corpses in a pit."], "type": ["COMMENT"]}

You can also create a 'generational' fort by setting the first value low and the second value high.  Doing this slows down the growth of a fort (less dwarfs = takes more time to do hauling/crafting/building) but also slows the encroachment of FPS death.\nAs for your alternative strategy of separating the dwarfs out, the easiest way to do this is to seal the fortress proper from the surface.  Put down a meeting hall in an airlock, sift through the dwarfs and recruit the dead-weight into a squad.  Order this squad to stand in an attached room that is really just an atom smasher (or retracting bridge over really really really deep hole; Semi-molten-rock-deep should do it).

First is just keep them locked out of the main fort, and have a meeting area in a place where you can kill them easily (drop the ceiling on them or drop the floor down a few levels). Second, you could use a burrow to temporarily quarantine the old dwarves while you handle sorting out the new ones, and only allow the ones with useful skills to join the old dwarves.

Sorry I am no help in fixing your current setup.\nYou do, however, have an easy way to get magma in minecarts.  Make sure you have 2 minecarts for every magma powered building you want, place a dump zone on a tile the magma will flood and dump all your magma safe minecarts to it.  Once they are all on the tile, flood it using the floodgates.  Let them sit until all are full.  Then cycle the floodgates to empty the tile.  Or use a screw pump.  \nMy own most-used method doesn't even use floodgates/bridges.  Just a tile with dumped minecarts next to a wall that can be channeled out to let magma in.  Channel out the wall, let the 2 tiles (channeled-tile and minecart-tile) fill with magma.  When full, use a pond zone and 2 buckets to drop water on the two tiles from 2+ levels up.
