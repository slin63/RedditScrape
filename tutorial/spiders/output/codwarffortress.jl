There are a number of other interactions that you can apply to creatures, so look around for the most !FUN! one. \nI'm not entirely sure where the file you're looking for lives, but it may be a few lines in another txt file!

Nah. I'll just try to cycle dwarves through.\nEdit: if one dwarf is a bit depressed at mucking out the caverns that once, that's preferable to a bunch of dwarves seeing all those corpses. Give the one dwarf some time off to recuperate, should be good.\nEdit 2: Wave after wave of goblin siege has broken on one little room (with probably more worth than any caravan that's passed through it). I stopped getting traders, and just got goblins. There were 40ish goblins last time. I installed a flush system, which goes from the aquifer into an atom smasher, because at this point I don't much care for haunting my poor dwarves, and hardly care about goblinite. \nSeriously, was that last siege I saw the fifth, or the sixth, siege in two years? It is a routine, at this point: dwarves get called inside, brute squad to the trade depot, prepare to man the stabbing levers. The goblins trigger traps, they mill about the murder pit, and then I start flooding them in, water rushing in from the side of the entrance and pushing them towards the constantly-stabbing spikes and the masterwork traps of guillotinesque efficiency.\nNot a single goblin has made it so far as the far side of that pit, which is just as well for them because there are more exceptional (and exceptionally valuable) weapon traps around every corner. Still, the sight of so much murder and death is distressing to my dwarves, and in their impregnable, and resplendent, home, they have taken to philosophize about the cruelty of caring so little for the well-being of such creatures. I think if any dwarf had died to a goblin lash since these defenses were operational they would be far less troubled by the task of throwing goblin corpses in a pit."], "type": ["COMMENT"]}

I'm still learning python myself, and this is actually my first attempt at using a GUI library (tkinter).\nBasically, DF outputs all announcements to a file called \n, it's how programs like soundsense determine what sounds to make. One every second this program will check if that file has any new announcements written to it. If new announcements are found, it will check each one against the regular expressions defined in \n, and return whatever tags you used to define that RE. \nThat information is passed to each window (top/bottom) and if the tags are set to be shown for that window, it will insert the announcement into a tkinter.Text object with the appropriate tkinter text tags (they define color, font, etc). This will make that announcement show up on the display with the appropriate color. Hiding the [][]-tag text and removing tag types after they have been displayed is done with liberal use of the elide option. Note, the tkinter.Text objects are the majority of the displays, usually they are used for text editing but I disabled that to make a sort of console.   \nIf you want to follow this process in the code, I would start by looking at the get_announcements() function in the class main_gui() in the 'Window.py' module.
