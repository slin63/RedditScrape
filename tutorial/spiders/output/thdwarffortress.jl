I have this giant pillar in the middle of my fort. It is 10 blocks high, 11 with octagon base. This \"tube\" houses a helix, that is the only access into my fort. Currently both the helix and pillar are made out of blood thorn wood, but looking at it, it looks way too plain. I would welcome ideas how to make it more interesting.\nOne of the solutions, that came to my mind, was just getting rid of the tube and exposing the helix. The only problem with it is, that on top of the pillar is a small \"island\" of rock. And it would look very unrealistic, the whole mass being supported just by the helix.\nAnother one was to reshape it, to look like forearm comming out of ground with hand holding the \"island\", but i don't think the scale is big enough to not make it look wierd.\nMy fort is at the point where i can buy pretty much any material, so you can be creative. Sadly i don't have enough candy to make it out of candy.\nMaterials i have in abundance:\n silver, copper, marble, lead, nickel, many rock types and same for wood.\nImgur to help with visualization:\nhttp://imgur.com/a/5I1U3\nCan provide save, if you want to experiment with it.\nThanks a lot"], "title": ["In need of aesthetic help"], "type": ["THREAD"]}

I found that its filters were pretty lacking, and was really annoyed that I had to manually scroll the window to see new announcements. Looking into it, the program was written 2+ years ago and it seems the author has abandoned the project. \nSo I decided to write my own program that fixed those issues. I'm pretty happy with what I came up with, and I think i've ironed out most of the bugs so i've decided to share it with you. \nGithub link: \nhttps://github.com/NuAoA/AnnouncementWindow\nScreenshots: \nhttp://i.imgur.com/aNx8dl2.png\nIts written in python (2.7.10) and will give you a live feed of your announcements and combat reports, so you don't need to pause the game anymore. Its similar the soundsense console, but you can hide different types of announcements and change the font/color. There are two windows you can configure filters for, allowing you to separate important announcements from the never ending combat reports (or the less important stuff: \"\nUrist mcHauler cancels Store Item in Stockpile: Item inaccessible.\n\"). The filters that it matches are loaded from a text file and can be edited however you want, as long as you have a basic understanding of regular expression syntax.\nI compiled a .exe for windows that you can find \nhere\n.
