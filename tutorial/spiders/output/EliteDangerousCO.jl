That\u2019s one of the best things about being a designer on Elite, to quote Forrest Gump, it\u2019s like a box of chocolates, you never know what you\u2019re gonna get. You get to work on multiple areas of the game and work with a great team to make the vision we have for the game a reality. \nOn a more personal level, I\u2019m particularly interested in adding more and more content to the game, so in addition to the content I add during the day, I also spend any spare minutes I find in the day trying to squeeze a new scenario here or there to add some more colour to the galaxy.  After all we have a lot of space to fill and you can never have enough content.\nI have to say I love my job, even on the days where we\u2019re all stressed and nothing is working as it should and a deadline is looming. To work on a game you\u2019ve loved since you were a kid and with a great team, I don\u2019t think you can ask for more than that.\nBut really there are so many favourite things, how I answer such a difficult question? I know let\u2019s try the medium of song (Interpretive dance doesn\u2019t work well in text):\nDriving on planets and shooting at skimmers,\nHazardous res sites and dog fighting vipers, \nHyperspace jumping and flying in wings,\nThese are a few of my favourite things.\nMeeting commanders and successful docking, \nMining for Painite and Rare item Trading,\nFinding Unknown Artifacts that go bing, \nThese are a few of my favourite things.\nExploring Nebulas and fuel scooping stars, \nBounties, combat zones and compromised beacons,\nDiscovering things first with scanners that go ping,\nThese are a few of my favourite things.\nWhen the Greeble bites, when the Thargoids sting, \nWhen I\u2019m feeling sad,\nI get in my Asp and fly into the black,\nAnd then I don\u2019t feel so bad.\nI also like the feeling of how small I am in the galaxy and doing my own thing in the game. It really makes me feel like I\u2019m out there in the black.\nThe game\u2019s audio. Have you heard it? Enough said. Seriously those guys are magicians, which explains Jim Croft\u2019s pointy hat. \nAnd last be not least the Team here at Frontier. They are awesome and it\u2019s great to work with all of them. \nFrom a design side of things, making gameplay and mechanics that are accessible to new players but deep enough for the veterans; encounters that are engaging and yet able to work with procedural systems and understanding how our players interact with our game and each other are the key challenges. These are things that interest most games designers I know and they are things that can be constantly be analysed and improved on and are different for each project you work on. \nMaking our gameplay work in multiplayer situations is also a big challenge. It\u2019s relatively simple to create gameplay that will work for a single player as you can centre everything round them and their actions can be predicted to a certain extent. But throw several other players into the mix and you have a totally different ball game where it\u2019s virtually impossible to say what players will do. While a big challenge, it\u2019s a good one to have and leads to some very interesting player on player encounters that we enjoy reading about in the forums.\nI think I have learnt a lot on Elite and will continue to learn more even after several years in the industry, as a designer you never stop learning and always try to make things better than you did before.\nBut if you think those are big challenges they pale into insignificance compare to getting to the fig rolls before the gameplay code team or winning a pun off with Dom \u201cThe Beautiful Corner\u201d Corner.\nEveryone (even us here at Frontier) wants something different from the game and they are mostly correct in their desires. This creates a vibrant, passionate and energetic work environment where we can debate all the ideas we have and throw them all in the melting pot and come up with the best outcome.\nWe are all in this thing together with our awesome passionate community. If we all work together we can make Elite the game we all want it to be. That is what we are attempting to do and it\u2019s great that we can engage with our community with things like the upcoming Nebula Station CG, the treasure hunts and the recent Mayhem Events (thanks Ed and Zac for that one). \nAlso Michael Brookes sees and knows all. \nFact 1:\nElite is strong in my family. My Dad has it, I have it and my brothers have it. This can create interesting, or if you ask my mum, very boring conversations as we compare notes and I say no comment a lot. For instance, my older brother and my dad have had an ongoing issue about who reached Elite first back in 1984. According to my brother, Dad pulled rank on \u201chis\u201d BBC Micro in order to reach Elite before him. My dad denies this. I was too young to really compete and just liked shooting the space ships a bit. Now they can finally solve the \u201cwho can get to elite first\u201d discussion and lay it to rest. \nFact 2:\nSome of the design team, I won\u2019t name names (cough Jim, Dan G) took away my man card because I like to bake, make soft toys and know how to do the wrapping a towel around your head thing after washing your hair. Apparently I\u2019m not getting it back any time soon, even if I bribe them with banana bread.\nWhat have you made recently that made someone else happy?\nAnswer Steve's delightful question in the forum thread here - (\n)"], "type": ["COMMENT"]}

Others can be identified to be part of a certain group. A group could have everything there is for guilds in other MMOs like taxes, a chat, some decal to identify yourself etc.\nLet players set up contracts to bulletin boards. For example: \nGive players the ability to own a station for their group. This could be achieved by being really active in powerplay with your group and earn the station as a reward for good service for example. \nYou can also lose it by being conquered from other players. Either a system has been conquered in powerplay or a trade blockade strips the station from it needed resources like food and medicine. If others influence other minor powers in your system too much, a station can also be lost.\nA station then can be upgraded and specialised. This would need your group to deliver resources to said station either by bringing them there themselves or by letting the traders bring it in. The station will pay the traders with stationcash. Each station has it's own cashflow and makes money. This way it can pay the traders for their goods.\nThe upgrades are seperated in 4 different categories: Special, Money, Shipyard and Outfitting with 3 tiers each, every Tier provides a bigger bonus:\n provides a unique bonus to that station that can be used by the station owners or the public for a fee.\n keeps the stations cashflow alive. Each station has it's own cashflow and makes money. This way it can pay the traders for their goods. Owners can use that cash to upgrade the station. If a station runs out of cash, they can not buy any goods, leading to famine or civil war if this goes on for too long.\n provides different ships to buy for everyone. Owners get a small discount.\n provides different modules to buy for everyone. Owners get a small discount.\nIt will look like this:\nThe more modules and tiers you have, the more upkeep you would have to pay for a station to work. Upkeep is payed with stationcash and resources for repairs and such. If you can not afford the upkeep, a module has to be disabled. if it stays disabled for too long, it will lose one tier.\nAlso a station has a need for resources like food and medicine. This need can be seen by any player that docks at that station. Similar as the demand in the trade menu we have right now. If those needs are not met, the station can riot or the people die because of hunger, leading to a final loss of the station if nothing is done.\nThis is just an overview and of course not final, but it would be a nice idea. Stations inside a power would be more civillian oriented while stations at the border are more military oriented. Some nice dynamic trade routes would occur making traders supply the different stations with resources. It would also make powerplay much more interesting because you can also pirate enemy trade routes to keep their stations from getting medicine for example.\nNot everyone is a group player but some want to own something too. Let players own their own little outpost. To make an outpost you'll need to find a certain spot and buy the rights to form an outpost there from one of the power leaders. Of course the one in which territory you want to build it.\nThen you and other players can bring resources there to build it up. It will function just like stations, but with much smaller bonuses and modules. \nIn the end outpost shouldn't be as costly as stations and provide an interesting way to make money:\nOf course those outpost need some upkeep as well and so on. Just like the stations in smaller.\nbasically the same with the above, just on the planets. Maybe a a defense module for skimmers and turrets. Don't have the time to fully flesh this one out.\nNothing of it is final, so it would be nice to not nail me down on any numbers or values. If you want to tell me your constructive criticism, feel free to do so. I may add more ideas later on."], "type": ["COMMENT"]}

X3 was a wonderful game because it presented that sort of complex autonomous A.I with complicated background systems dictating resources and goals, it was able to achieve a dynamic game capable of giving the player unpredictable events.

It's so hard to tell a plausible story around what you are doing. Why am I going to this nav beacon to shoot pirates? Why am I flying from my faction HQ to some control system to deliver \"stuff\". Why should I care about any cargo other than palladium?\nThe game needs more character and story. Old games like XWing or Tie Fighter took simple gameplay mechanics and told a great story using text before and after the mission. Going from point A to B to C needs to make sense. I love the amount of entertainment Grand Theft Auto gives you with NPC banter as you drive to the next mission. There is a ton of down time due to travel in ED. They could fill it with more interesting story, character, or event based interaction. Look at the context Mass Effect gives players on each mission. It's still just shooting and wandering, but the context is what makes it interesting. \nI really hope ED one day has a Freespace 2 style of cinematic storytelling through single/coop missions told using this amazing game world and engine. Please give us missions with story and depth along the lines of The Witcher 3, where each phase of investigation, dialogue, exploration, and combat has context and meaning. \nFrom an MMO perspective, give us something like Destiny or Guild Wars where we can match up with other players before going on a multi stage PvE or PvP mission with context. This way players make unique stories and missions together. \nBasically I'm hoping Elite Dangerous goes from a bunch of cool technology to an actual work of art with deep storytelling and player interaction.

Not only would a player/ clan need to raise the funds and means to construct or buy a station, but running one could be fraught with potential overheads and risks to balance out the ongoing rewards. Poor management, bad trade flows or sabotage could perhaps render the investment negative. \nPlayer owned stations would add more strategic and tactical depth. Founding a station next to a resource belt or earth-like in order to control access to some certain resource could be a major point of contention between players. This would encourage not just turf war but also exploration and prospecting.\nOnce these stations are already owned and built, they should be subject to attack. Currently the main problem with E:D war is that its just endless blowing stuff up. In my opinion, it needs not just objectives but also location focus to be more interesting. You can easily see how station battles would contribute to tactical depth too. Perhaps the defenses could be manned or pre-automated in some secret way requiring the attackers to disable certain systems in a sequence that might not be obvious before the battle starts. Perhaps a very bulky explosive needs to be delivered by a dedicated cargo vessel by the attackers and this would require protecting/ destroying. You could easily see how such a mechanic would lead to emergent tactics like decoys etc. Games like battlefield already have multi stage objectives but a game like E:D could perhaps surpass that since you can easily imaging how the battlefield will be designed my players rather than a map which is endlessly repeated.I think it would be good if along with these stations, finite defensive and offensive NPCS could be bought and deployed by players giving more meaning to earning additional cash.\nAlong with Player owned stations I think another very rare resource system, with some perpetual resources that need to be found rather than bought, could be implemented. If such resources were necessary to the construction and maintenance of powerful ship and station modules, or if sustained possession of them gave a player and/ or his clan some buffs- this would go a long way to integrating the exploration/ combat/ mining and powerplay professions which at the moment feel totally separated from one another. It would be great if you could still be a valuable member of a player owned faction as a miner or explorer for example."], "type": ["COMMENT"]}

If text, then something like:\nOnce targeted, the rock would gain a false color overlay showing a heat map of mineral concentration. The initial map is low resolution, but you aim at a nice red spot and shoot a prospector limpet at it. The prospector does a sampling/survey routine and increases the resolution of the scan around it.\nNow comes the finesse, you use your mining lasers to hit the area of highest concentration.

Ore chunks fly off and still must be scooped up, but you can't scoop while you drill so it's best to have a buddy along in a t-6 or something.

How we're almost a year post release and it's still just a fucking RES farm is beyond me.\nA quick and easy fix to start with would be to nerf RES farming right into the ground, but buff assassination missions and supercruise bounties to replace it. At least those involve some actual hunting and are affected by the background sim. A contract to kill an Anaconda and two Vultures could net you around 5-10 mil this way, for example.\nThe next step could be to make targets actually flee so you have to chase them down. Maybe give us some way to stop them while you're at it. The problem here is that NPC's in ED are client-side and once they leave the instance they're essentially gone forever. But the way it could work is that NPC's can flee to another system, you can scan their wake if you want, and if you then go to the same system as them they spawn there with you, similar to how NPC's can already chase you through instances. Rinse and repeat until you actually manage to snare and kill your target.\nMeanwhile, RES farming could be turned into more of a system security type thing, by adding a mechanic whereby NPC's (such as miners) will give you money for saving their lives. The same thing could carry over to NPC's in supercruise, etc. Alternatively, some RES could be like pirate proving grounds, where you go to cause shit and then progressively more and harder pirates come to take you up on it. Like wave defense but without the waves.\nThere's so much more that could be done with bounty hunting, but I'd really like to see these basic things fixed at least. Especially RES farming. It's absurd that we've come to accept it as the go-to way of bounty hunting when the two barely have anything in common."], "type": ["COMMENT"]}

With the option to turn it off of course. People could advertise for security and escorts and looking for wing mates and stuff. We should not have to resort to forums and sub teddits for this. Why does Frontier hate player interaction so damn much. You called it an MMO, let us talk to each other at least, damn it.\nSilent running should be way more effective in PVP and be a viable strategy for small ships vs big ships. It would be super cool to have to try and shake off a bunch of Eagles in a Conda and actually have it be super frustrating. As it should be.\nShip walking!!! What's the point of having an orca or an Anaconda if you can only admire your windshield. I want to walk through the cafeteria in my anaconda and park by a cool earth like or a pair of neutron stars and take a walk down to my observation deck.\nRank increases should be scripted story line events an scripted story line events should have audio transmissions, like in the trailer. Just audio for anything. They did the station voices so well, why not start creeping that into the rest of the game?\nGet rid of SCB's. They're ruining PVP IMO.\nInterior customizations. If all we get to look at is our dash and our hands give us cool windshield trim or gloves or something. Fuzzy dice and bumper stickers? \nLarge scale Powerplay PVP. That matters. Make it possible for two factions to go to war and have a front line where players fight for supremacy of a station over a set period of time or something. It would actually be like the trailer, ships darting between struts and station supports, lasers flying everywhere, shit going  all crazy. Would give them excuses to bust out more Capitol ships too. People would flock to it.\nShip voices. I don't care if they cost money. I'll pay a few bucks for a sarcastic TARS rip off that makes fun of me when I smash into the control tower trying to land. I've turned off most of the voice audio in my cockpit because I've just heard it so damn much.\nThere should actually be something at RES' and ships should gravitate towards it, not random laser space battles 20k away from the RES marker 5k above the roids. Even if it was just a cheesy Blade Runneresque rotating neon Lakon sign or a big flying space crane or something. \n Let me have my two primary weapons and have a button on my mouse just for missiles.

ATM any NPCs that are found in CZs tend to just be using the tactic \"throw our people at the other people until they die\".\nAnd then within the control points themselves I'd like to see more coordination: Faction A is aligned with the federation so they choose to spend X amount of credits to \"rent\" a capital ship to defend their station. Faction B assesses that the best option for it to do is to take the station. Faction B purchases a well-rounded force and attacks the station. Everyone within the station is automatically launched and when the last person leaves the blast doors close. Within 10 minutes Faction B's force has almost been destroyed by A's capital ship, but B still thinks that the station is still worth attacking. Because B now knows  what it's up against, It's buying patterns become more organised. B now buys waves of eagles in groups of three, each carrying one torpedo with escorts. When each wave joins the station the eagles hide behind the escorts and lets them take all the incoming fire. Once they reach 5km from the capital ship the escort breaks formation and begins firing short bursts erratically, to provide cover fire for the eagles. These groups of three eagles fly in formation towards the capital ship. They are then assigned targets and perform bombing runs on their selected targets with their bombs. They then try to jump out, and if they succeed Faction B is then refunded the money it took to purchase them, minus the cost of the ammunition. \nThis continues until both the capital ship is defeated or either Faction has either run out of money or decides to give up on trying to hold/attack the station."], "type": ["COMMENT"]}

If yes, then set down the slider for your sticks to around 50% and start working from there.\nI'll try to help you if I can with setting up a good control profile. My experience so far has been with KBD and mouse, Joystick (t16k), and the 360 wireless controller for PC. \nThe most basic binds I use are:\nObviously, you can use different kinds of combinations, suit to your own liking. I'm just giving some examples to set you in the right direction.\nIf you have sensitivity control, you are already ahead of me. The PC 360 controller doesn't have any options like that in the driver, or in the game. I've been truly enjoying flying with it nevertheless! You just have to be gentle on the sticks and practice your new bindings well with the canister tutorial, at peace. \nFurthermore, you will have to settle with using gimballed weapons only for now. With time, you might be able to use fixed weapons, but for now better forget about them and just get (G)s. \nI've been mostly flying the Viper, Vulture, Cobra, Eagle, Sidewinder and today I bought a Diamondback Scout. I love all of them, and they are all capable of some serious dps. \nRemember - the smaller your ship - the cheaper your maintenance is. If you feel like a noob, aim for a Viper, then learn to play with it, using 2 gimballed lasers and 2 gimballed multi-cannons. Lasers for shields, then cannons to eat through hull. You can get really good with the controller, just give it a shot.\nedit: Some flying tips - your ship is always most maneuverable when your speed is at the yellow sweet spot, shown at your speed meter. Try to keep it right there when you enter a turnfight with someone. Learn to reduce your speed at will in order to stay behind your target, or in a position from which he cannot shoot at you. Use your up/down thrusters with the right stick to help yourself turn and face your target until your weapons auto aim into your target. Always try to select the Power Plant of your enemy as a sub-target. Select the Drives if your enemy is trying to escape, but the power plant is not damaged enough to finish it off. Feel free to turn Flight Assist off for a few seconds to help you turn towards your enemy a bit faster. Learn to turn it off and on at will, without panicking and losing control. Learn the angle at which your gimballed weapons obtain their target and can hit successfully, also the maximal distance from which they can make contact with your target."], "type": ["COMMENT"]}

At the time black holes were set up using roughly the same algorithms as stars were.

I was able to get within ~30km of that black hole after I took this video. After that you bounce off of an invisible placeholder/wall just like you do with planets, and get the message \"body exclusion zone hit\"\nAs I said, this is a placeholder; horizons will remove it from atmosphere-less planets, and eventually more plandings will remove them from all planets/gas giants, and FDev has stated that eventually they want to introduce spaghettification to black holes, meaning if you go near or across the current limit, you will most likely die an extremely slow, painful, and absurd death."], "type": ["COMMENT"]}

Your headlights won't save you. A roid will loom out of the dark before you have a chance to avoid it.\nIf you're faster than your opponent, you can control the engagement and decide whether to fight or run.\nLearn to manage your sensor range, putting it up and down as needed. Two steps up from minimum is good for combat, maximum is good for keeping an eye out on how far other ships are relative to you. In the middle is decent for landing and take off to see if ships are coming in and out of the station in front of you.\nLearn how pips, your capacitors and the effect of a better distributor work. Practice managing your pips on the fly once you have basic flying mastered.\nLearn how the heat mechanics work. This helps with smuggling, stealth builds for ships and understanding how scans and contacts and unresolved contacts on your scope work.\nThe wobble on gimballed weapons means they will only intermittently hit beyond about 1km range. Sniping can only really be done with fixed weapons.\nCurrently, normal missiles and fragment cannons are a bit rubbish. ECM is not considered a useful module compared to the completely automated Point Defence. If you want to try ECM, read how it works first (you have to hold down the fire button to expand its area of effect and when you release, it affects that area. The longer you hold it down, the bigger the area, but of course if you leave it too long, whatever missile/mine was going to hit you might already have done it, so it's a push your luck mechanic. In reality, most people panic and just tap it, making it affect a worthless 50m around the ship, and then the missile hits them anyway. Later they install point defence instead).\nYou can filter the Galaxy Map for scoopable stars. O B A F K and M class. Click where it says 'Allegiance' and change it to 'Star Class', then untick everything but them. They're the main sequence stars (which the devs happened to also choose to be the scoopable stars). The well-known mnemonic for remembering them is 'Oh Be A Fine Girl/Guy, Kiss Me'."], "type": ["COMMENT"]}

It's got great potential to be a source of mid-to-endgame fun for a lot of players, gives players and groups great agency in shaping the galaxy, and could inject much-wanted story into what's going on in the galaxy.  \nA few points I think could be improved upon:\n Get some writers to add bios to the leaders. Put biographies into an \"About\" tab on the power overview. Right now, I see these leaders as a collection of bonuses and penalties applied to systems, rather than characters with their beliefs and agendas they're trying to spread. This is \n bad with leaders outside the Empire, who see less coverage on Galnet news reports. Example: I know Felicia Winters is the Shadow President of the Federation... but I have absolutely no idea what the Shadow President is! Pure speculation on my part is that she's the leader of an 'official opposition' in the Federation government, the space she 'controls' is the parts of Fed space that agree with her, and Rhea is where she was elected... but that's pure speculation/headcanon and not supported anywhere in-game that I know of.\n Powerplay activities should be restricted to Open Play. Powerplay is a grand collaborative effort as a faction, competing against other player factions. Solo/Private players aren't adding anything and lead to 5th column efforts that can't be stopped, and ignorant/bad merit grinders achieving the same bad results. \n Someone needs to take a look at Merits awarded for fortifying, especially for lower ranks within a faction. Being allowed to earn 10 Merits at a time for a multi-leg journey is pointless compared to being given 30 at a time for killing NPCs somewhere else. Fortifying in its current state is a chore for your Rank 5 players; wealthy ones who can afford to fast-track multiple supply shipments.\n Some of the power-specific rewards need to be looked at. The power-specific modules range cover a spectrum of usefulness from Best-in-class Module (Prismatic Shields, Imperial Hammer) to Niche Utility Tool (Mining Lance) to Useless Trash (Cytoscrambler). The rank bonuses similarly range from amazingly good (ALD's doubling of bounty payouts) to mystifyingly useless (Li Yong Rui's tripled data payout... how the hell do you maintain Rank 5 AND do a lot of exploring?). If we want meaningful competition between factions, it won't do to have some factions massively out-reward others. I'd suggest giving extra modules to the factions who currently have marginal ones; e.g. another 'utility' one to Torval and a hull-cracking weapon to Archon. \nI think there's more, and other redditors might want to add to this list, but I think that'd be the top 4. Add story, bring it to Open, even up the merit rewards, and make the faction rewards better for some of the weaker ones. "], "type": ["COMMENT"]}

Here's some gameplay elements in no particular order that I believe are worthy of experimentation in ED.\nThere are many different types of equippable laser weapons in Freespace, and each is statistically weighted and balanced (or unbalanced) by a few factors: rate of fire, energy draw, damage against shields, damage against hull, and occasionally some special twist.\nSome examples: a laser that has a kinetic effect that could send your ship tumbling; a laser that drains the energy from your capacitor; a laser that incurs almost no shield or hull damage but is very good against subsystems; an EMP laser that can glitch out your target's HUD; a TAG laser that does no damage, but \"lights up\" your target on all your wing's sensors so their missiles can home in. It all goes towards making combat more interesting, tactical, and unpredictable.\nLike ED, the Freespace lore also includes some notable manufacturers which compete in designs and utility.\nI'd like ED to have a larger variety of laser weapons, and use expense and mounting restrictions to balance more effective weapon stats.\nReally, I'm talking about missiles. I love how Freespace did missiles. You essentially had three types: dumbfire, heat-seeking, and aspect-seeking.\nDumbfire missiles are essentially useless and are the default noob ordinance. They're low yield, but fast to target and you can store hundreds of them. Very useful in breaking up asteroids on a collision path with your convoy!\nHeat-seeking missiles are a bit more powerful, short-to-medium range, and have generally accurate homing to the target. They're also fire and forget, since the missile will continue to track the target's heat signature, so lock will not be broken if you change your target. However, their tracking can be easily defeated by chaff, a heat-sink launch, or silent running.\nAspect-seeking missiles are the strongest, medium-to-long range, and have extremely accurate homing to the target. However, in order to acquire target lock, you must keep your target relatively centered in your HUD for 5-30 seconds (depending on missile variety) while a secondary reticle enters and \"locks\" on the target. Essentially it is YOUR ship's targeting computer that is supplying telemetry to the missile, so you must keep a lock on your target until your missile impacts, otherwise it turns into dumbfire. You can also fire them as dumbfire without getting a lock. They're very accurate homing, and can only be deterred by a well-timed chaff or some savvy maneuvering.\nSPECIAL MISSILES! Freespace include a couple of really neat missiles that would be at home in ED: a large missile that explodes into a swarm of small anti-fighter missiles; a tactical anti-subsystem missile; an EMP missile that temporarily glitches the HUD, comms, and sensors of any craft caught in the blast radius, etc.\nNo missile has an indefinite fuse, and will explode if they don't find a target within XX seconds. All missiles have a target range. Larger, slower missiles can actually be targeted by interceptors and shot down before impacting their targets.\nEDIT: I gotta take a break here, but I'll add more thoughts soon!"], "type": ["COMMENT"]}

The further out you go the more likely there are pirates. This creates a game of cat and mouse as you would try to go out further to mine better minerals (or be further away from NPC's) and have to race back to safety in between loads. It would also encourage wing protection, bounty hunters and piracy all at the same time.

It doesn't matter if you hit a target in the front or rear, both pull from the same pool of HP.

As a side note, these are long distance mission that people were using to make a crazy amount of credits not too long ago before they nerfed it. Long distance smuggling missions used to show up a lot more and the smuggling missions sometimes offer something like 500,000 credits per ton for traveling 400 light years. \nTo answer your question, I can probably come up with some sort of justification for the existence of the mission. Let's first assume the distance is the reason for the high reward. I am also going to assume that the station does not intend to sell the cargo for a profit, but rather use it for something else, just because it seems like there would be no way to make a profit when you're paying that much to transport it. You are getting paid to transport the cargo a really long distance, which makes sense because most of the other low paying contracts don't require you to travel that far. Now, why would the station pay so much to transport cargo from so far away rather than from somewhere closer? Maybe they don't want another faction to know they are importing a commodity and if they imported from a local source they would be found out. Maybe they have a contract with a distant station that requires them to import a minimum amount of cargo from them per month as part of some trade deal they made. Maybe they want to make friends with another distant faction and an easy way to do that is buy their goods. There are lots of ways to justify the mission because you can assume they are not telling you, the courier, the entire story about why they want this cargo."], "type": ["COMMENT"]}

A Pulse laser is ~50% more capacitor efficient than a Beam, but only does ~20% less damage. Overall, 2x Pulse is more efficient capacitor wise than Beam and Cannon and also does more damage, at least to shields.  \nHowever, you might value the hull damage of the Cannon: one of the reason for the preference was that pre-1.4, you could ignore armour and kill NPCs fast just by shooting the Powerplant, which Pulse lasers were really good for. Now you still need to wipe out the hull to destroy them.\nMy personal preference? Swap out the Beam for a Pulse and a Cannon for a Plasma Accelerator. More damage and more efficient. Plus you'll get better at leading your target and aiming with fixed weapons"], "type": ["COMMENT"]}
