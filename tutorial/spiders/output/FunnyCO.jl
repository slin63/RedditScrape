You clearly know nothing of rope.\nHemp is mostly preferred. Jute is similar but the stiffness and abrasiveness mean its mostly used for photo shoots since it lays real pretty.\nIf you want to go synthetic then mfp or nylon are the way to go. These are most frequently used when the rope will need to be washed since synthetic fibers don't shrink in water. They are also sometimes used as main support lines for suspension since they handle higher amounts of weight better. They are generally less frequently used then natural fibers since they have a tendency to slip and you have to put extra knots in place to keep them secure.\nSilk would only be used for a very sensual scene where you want the feel of of rope but not the actual secure ness of a real tie. It's just too slippery to hold a real knot"], "type": ["COMMENT"]}

(This might actually be a pretty good idea for a web site!)\nI have to pay a web hosting company some money per month to host my site, and that money varies depending on how much traffic I serve. So, if the site gets popular, it costs more. However, I also serve ads on awesome.butt, and they make enough money to offset those hosting costs. So that's pretty good.\nThen, someone else comes along and thinks the butts on my site are pretty great, and they want to feature them on a news site called Buttington Post. They write up a quick story on Buttington Post and include a dozen of the hottest butts from awesome.butt in the story.\nBut here's the thing: instead of re-hosting those pictures on the Buttington Post servers, they just use the original image links from awesome.butt. So when a visitor goes to the Buttington Post and clicks on the \"12 Butts so Awesome They'll Blow Your Goddamn Mind\" post, the butt pictures are served up from the awesome.butt server, not from the Buttington Post server.\nBandwidth costs money, so I have to pay to serve those pictures. Doesn't matter who looks at them or how they see them\u2014if they are served by the awesome.butt server, I pay. But because the readers aren't visiting awesome.butt to see the pix, they're not seeing my ads, so my hosting bill goes up without me being able to serve more ads to compensate the extra bill.\nAnd that's hotlinking.\nAh, you ask, so everything would have been okay if Buttington Post had just saved the images and rehosted them on their servers, right?\nThat's another ELI5, but the short answer is \n because depending on your intention and the kind of image, that might be copyright infringement. A news site like Buttington Post could perhaps re-host one or two images if they're using those images editorially, but crazily enough photographers and artists tend to want to be compensated for their work and the best thing to do is for a org like Buttington to simply link to the page hosting the content without hotlinking or re-hosting, full stop."], "type": ["COMMENT"]}

An example of this would be that if you are tied to a chair you do not have the circumstantial freedom to go to a movie theater. Almost all philosophers will agree that we possess circumstantial freedom. The debate about free will comes with metaphysical freedom which says that we are truly free to choose from genuine alternatives.

Basically Huffington Post directly linked to the images hosted on Matt Inman's AWS instances rather than re-hosting the images on their own site.\nNot only does this practice cost more in hosting/usage fees against his AWS account, but also denies Inman the page views to his site.  If it was a link to the actual comic page rather than the images themselves, he would be getting the ad revenue and visibility of his store to make the bandwidth usage worth it.  Essentially in this case, most people aren't going to go to his site after viewing the comic, so Huffington Post is basically getting the ad-revenue from its own site while costing Inman hosting fees for little benefit to him.  The additional issue is that HuffPo is using his content without any sort of licensing agreement (if Inman chose to require one), so they're using his artwork for profit without paying him for it."], "type": ["COMMENT"]}

The pose looks comical nowadays, as if they are actors in a silent movie rather than pugilists.\nThe stance and guard were low because bare-knuckle boxing consisted largely of striking the opponent's body. The skull is an extremely hard object, and a full-force punch to an opponent's head could easily result in a broken hand. This is why so many bar-room brawls end after one punch. The \"boxer's fracture\" a break behind the knuckle of the little finger is regularly seen in hospital casualty departments at weekends.\nThe Marquess of Queensberry rules took off not because society viewed the new sport as more civilised than the old, but because fights conducted under the new guidelines attracted more spectators. Audiences wanted to see repeated blows to the head and dramatic knockouts.\nBy contrast, the last bare-knuckle heavyweight contest in the US in 1897 dragged on into the 75th round. Since gloves spread the impact of a blow, the recipient of a punch is less likely to be blinded, have their teeth knocked out or their jaw broken. However, gloves do not lessen the force applied to the brain as it rattles inside the skull from a heavy blow. In fact, they make matters worse by adding 10oz to the weight of the fist.\nA full-force punch to the head is comparable to being hit with a 12lb padded wooden mallet travelling at 20mph. Gerald McClellan took around 40 such blows over the course of his world title fight against Nigel Benn in 1995. Even the most hardened spectators were shocked by its brutality.\nNeither fighter made any great attempts to defend himself. Instead, the two stood toe to toe, trading punches. As a result, McClellan suffered brain damage that left him blind, 80 per cent deaf and paralysed.\nAs the bare-knuckle campaigner Dr Alan J Ryan pointed out: \"In 100 years of bare-knuckle fighting in the United States, which terminated around 1897 with a John L Sullivan heavyweight championship fight, there wasn't a single ring fatality.\" Today, there are three or four every year in the US, and around 15 per cent of professional fighters suffer some form of permanent brain damage during their career. Worldwide, there have been over 400 boxing deaths in the last 50 years alone. The total would be far higher were it not for the advances in medical care that saved the lives of fighters such as McClellan and Michael Watson. A return to bare knuckles would be bloodier and less acceptable to mass television audiences, but one has to ask whether wheelchairs and life-support machines are any easier on one's conscience."], "type": ["COMMENT"]}

I graduated with a cs degree and knew most data strutures and algs, but most of the questions they throw at you, you just simply can't know without further studying. (Unless your genius-i tip my hat to you). Go look at career cup and study the questions that pertain to the company you want to interview for. Keep studying! Then the resume, I found that it is pretty easy to get a phone screen. Just cater your resume to that company or position they are hiring for (position for cloud position-talk about course work that you did with cloud stuff). Use action words in our resume (I organized, I directed, etc) and also use buzz words (used git , used open mp, used hadoop). I used indeed to find positions. Pretty easy living near seattle, wa.

It uses its own cell-surface transporter, called GLUT5, which is actually not found in your Pancreatic Beta Cells - the cells that secrete insulin in your body. Sounds amazing for diabetics, but at the same time Fructose has been shown to mobilize triglyceride (fatty acid) synthesis, storage and glycogen buildup (\"water weight\"). What this comes down to, in the way I have been taught, is that Fructose is safe for insulin-response when consumed in small quantities  (20-30g/day, the same you would find in a \n fruit) but in excess can lead to massive weight gain. Now judging how one can of soda has 40g of sugar as High Fructose Corn Syrup (55% fructose content, 45% glucose) you are getting 22g of fructose in just that can, forget everything else you eat in that day, and you are pairing it with insulin activating glucose. Its really a recipe for disaster, especially for a tiny child.\nRegarding glycemic index, i have concern with not only the number assigned (100 for sugar/bread, 40 for potatoes, etc) because this does not take into account the time delay of how carbohydrates are trickling into your blood. This \"slow carb\" is often regarded as good, and i think its a good place to start for sugar/bread addicts, but i would take concern with it still.\nTL:DR Eat your vegetables, avoid HFCS.\nEDIT: words"], "type": ["COMMENT"]}

But you're chocking it all up to luck, and that's equally shitty. \"oh, you got lucky, that's all. it just doesn't work out for most people.\" .. That's ridiculous. Most graduates from good schools in good programs end up with decent jobs.\nThere are plenty of problems with our higher education system. Like people being sold false hope that their AA degree or BA in History will land them an awesome job with benefits. Or that you can go to any school for any subject and as long as you graduate you'll be fine.

This is simply not true.  There are plenty of people that borrowed money, went to college, and busted their ass, and still had trouble or can't find a job.  Was it because they're lazy idiots?  No, things just didn't work out the same.  \nThere are all sorts of invisible help too from changes in the economy, popularity of field of study, down to the very person hiring you.  I know you want to say I worked hard and did it! and I'm sure you did.  That DOES NOT mean that it's the same for everyone.\nYou use these common generalized examples that reinforce your belief, but they are a biased perspective that assumes all apples are like the bad ones.  Every unemployed grad is NOT an art student that assumed they could get an easy job.  \nAlways easy to say from someone who was successful.  I could point thousands of college grads your way so you can show them a repeatable, reliable way to earn what you did.  \nLook, the point of all this is that you have very good circumstances, and most people do not have what you have even when they try really hard.

This is a big one.\nI got to skip a class for a day if I needed to, as long as I covered for what I missed. Can't do that at work.  This is the \"free time\" so many people say they get with a steady job.\nI got to hang out with people who liked the same things I did, got my references, and could intellectually stimulate me. Literally none of that happens at my job. This is huge.  I was learning material I cared a great deal for, because I wasn't just there to get a job when I was done.  I honestly have a hard time understanding those who chose to (in my opinion) waste their time in college just for that reason.  I got a history degree and love history, and no where else have I been able to get the intellectual stimulation I got in college.\nSo...I know the workload is tough. I worked through college too, for 7 years. But... the workplace isn't always the grand freedom and beautiful world it may look like from here."], "type": ["COMMENT"]}
