Would need to be a pristine metallic ring.)\nBounty Hunter goal - Turn in X amount of bounty claims, offering protection wings for the miners.\nPirates goal - Be a freaking pirate and have fun.\nBlockade the star if possible. Lockdown the system and control incoming and outgoing traffic to benefit your side.\nThis type of CG offers incentives for each type of player, adding a sense of danger and accomplishment when a tier is met. This really gives player groups a way to come together and work for a single goal.\nMake the only RES available a Haz Res site. Miners get really good metals, bounty hunters have a constant stream of both NPC and player pirates to deal with and pirates...attempt to pirate those groups. Allow black market metals turned in to count towards the goal.\nThe idea is to allow everyone to have a goal, and not just a single goal. Too many times there has been one focus for these community goals, which only caters to a portion of the player base.\nJust my .02 cents."], "author": ["ObtuseMoose87"], "type": ["THREAD"]}

The powerplay government thing sounded neat, but it felt like it was the mission thing again. I just feel like no matter what I'm doing it's the same thing over and over again for no real reason. So I'm curious. Am I playing this game wrong and skipping something, or do I just not get \"it\"?"], "author": ["iamanoobnow"], "type": ["THREAD"]}
