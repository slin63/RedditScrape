It feels a lot like Riot is not taking the playing environment on OCE seriously, and I want us as a community to show that we are not okay with the current state of affairs and we want this to be a higher priority. I think that this is something that everyone who plays on the server can get behind, and hopefully some of you from other servers will be able to sympathise with our situation and throw in your support.\n\u00a0\nWho am I\nBy way of background, I love League of Legends. I started playing this game around preseason 3. I've spent hundreds of dollars on it, and put countless of hours in. I climbed from bronze, to silver, to gold, to plat, putting in thousands of games along the way. I was introduced to this game by my two brothers - both of whom have also spent hundreds of dollars and played thousands of games over the past few years. I'm saying this so that you know, I'm not some whiny guy looking to hop on the bash Riot bandwagon. I love this game and I want to keep playing it. I just feel like that is becoming increasingly difficult.\n\u00a0\nSo what's the problem?\nI think there are a few major problems with the OCE server at the moment, but by far the most serious issue is that there seems to be virtually no oversight of player behaviour. The Oceanic server never had a Tribunal. We have been excluded from the recent updates that were released on NA regarding player punishment for toxic behaviour and leaving/AFKing. I have been reporting people for years now, knowing fully that nobody will ever read my reports, and nothing will ever be done about them. I just came out of a normal game with my brothers in which we were constantly flamed by the duo on our team. Unfortunately, this sort of thing happens every other game. It has gotten to the point where we can only ever stomach playing one game of League in a session, and then decide it's time to stop, because we come away from the game feeling unhappy instead of having enjoyed our time. I am not even slightly exaggerating when I say that there is currently a culture of \ncomplete\n impunity for toxicity on the server - everyone knows fully well that they can say whatever they want, and there will be no consequences. My brothers barely ever play anymore, explicitly because they find the vocal toxic player community unbearable, and I'm considering joining them. \n\u00a0\nWell, what do you want us to do about it?\nI know we can't be the only ones who don't enjoy playing on a server with this kind of player environment. There's only so many times you can mute toxic teammates - when it starts to happen in every second game, there's a bigger problem at play here. I want us to tell Riot clearly that as much as we love their game, we play it to have fun. Our time, and our money, are a result of us having a positive experience while playing their game. I want us to send them a message that we're not okay with this problem being put on low priority (or, what seems to be more accurate, being ignored all together) on our server. As it is now, Riot seem content to let the server continue its downward spiral. I'd like to think that if we can get enough upvotes to get this to the front page, or get some kind of serious discussion going, it will at least put the issue on their radar. \nIn short, I want you to contribute so that Riot knows this is our top priority as players, and we want it to be their top priority too.\n\u00a0\nedit:\n I just want to comment on some things people have said. Some of you have said that toxicity on OCE is not any worse than on any other server. Having lived in NA and Europe for several months each recently, I've had a chance to play on EUW, NA and OCE. There are obviously toxic players on all of them, but OCE has been by far the least pleasant experience I've ever had playing this game. Obviously that's anecdotal - but plenty of commenters seem to feel the same way. I also think it's quite possible that this is a problem that affects all the smaller servers (TR, LAS, etc.) as some commenters have said, but having never played on those servers, I can't really say either way."], "title": ["Can we please talk about the OCE server?"], "type": ["THREAD"]}

Reddit's been participating for a few years now, and we decided to try to get in on the charity action this year.  On November 7th, thousands of people will be streaming games in support of children hospitals all around North America.  \nCMN is very \nhighly rated\n and posts its audits \npublicly\n.  All money donated for this event goes directly to the hospitals' discretionary funds (which the hospitals can use for any expenses they didn't plan for, like a child who can't afford treatment).\nTeam Soraka vs. Team Reddit\nToday we are announcing that we are competing directly against Team Reddit to see who can raise $50,000 first for this charity event.  You can check up on how each of us are doing \nat this link\n.  Team Reddit got a bit of a head start on us, so we have some catching up to do!\nWhat is at stake?\nIf we win, the admins participating in Team Reddit have agreed that during their respective streams, they will dedicate 4 hours of their streaming time trying to learn how to play League of Legends.  If they win, the mods who are participating in Team Soraka have agreed to spend 4 hours playing whatever game the admins choose for us.\nEither way, the result should be fun for everyone involved.  May the best team win (which will totally be Team Soraka)\nHow can I help Team Soraka win?\nYou can do several things to help us get the edge over Team Reddit!  \nFirst,\n you can \ndonate\n! You can donate to the team directly through our \nhead to head\n challenge page.  You could also donate on behalf of specific members of each team if you look us up or something.  Remember, this event is really similar to an event like Race for the Cure, we need people's help to succeed in raising money for this cause.\nSecond,\n you can \njoin the team\n and try to raise money yourself!  After going to our \nteam page\n click \"join team\" and it should get you on your way!  What you're doing by joining the team is pledging to stream for around 24 hours around November 7th.  It is based on the honor system, so if you need to cut your stream a little short no one is going to judge you.  During your stream, you can play any game you want.  It's your stream.  Have fun with it.\nThird,\n you can \nspread the word\n!  Talk about Team Soraka!  Tweet about it (#\nRaka4thekids\n)!  Tell your facebook friends about it.  Help us spread the word about this event so as many people know that it is happening as possible.\nIs there anywhere on reddit we can go to talk about this?\nThere sure is!  If you want to talk with Team Soraka members, \njoin us in \n/r/TeamSoraka\n!  If you want to talk with other participants in Team Reddit, they have a community set up in \n/r/ExtraLife\n you can join.  Either way, there is a subreddit for that!\nRemember to sport your Team Soraka flair!  I'm sporting mine and you can too by choosing the flair in the sidebar.\nAt the time that I wrote this announcement, we're currently behind Team Reddit by about $19,000.
