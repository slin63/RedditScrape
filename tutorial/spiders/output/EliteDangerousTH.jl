In terms of relative realism for the game, wouldn't it make more sense for the builders putting out the contract, to outline how many tonnes of each metal or mineral is required to build the station? \nIf everyone decided that they would deliver Gold for the Kaushpoos CG, it would be quite silly to think that the station would even be possible to construct. What I'd like to see in these kind of community goals is something along the lines of \"X company has put out a contract for willing commanders to deliver (just as an example) 300 thousand tonnes of Gold, 1.5 million tonnes of Titanium, 1 million tonnes of Aluminum (and so on and so on)...commanders are offered generous compensation for their efforts\".  \nI think this kind of system would be a lot more interesting than just the current deliver whatever you want, and if enough tonnes are collected the next tier is unlocked. I think the tiers could be unlocked based on the amount of each material delivered. For example, the lowest amount of material needed would be used as the first tier, so using the examples above, the first tier would be to deliver 300k tonnes of gold to the station, and once that's completed the second tier would unlock. Which would be deliver 1 million tonnes of Aluminum, and that would continue until every amount of each material needed is delivered, thereby completing the CG. This would facilitate more communication and cooperation between commanders in my mind, as they could tell eachother the best place to get whatever material is needed. And perhaps it would open the door to new and exciting gameplay in the community."], "title": ["The Mechanics of the Kaushpoos Community Goal."], "type": ["THREAD"]}

To this end I was turned onto the idea of Star Citizen. Big persistent open universe, first person view, awesome.\nHowever at this point Star Citizen was far from playable (and still has a very long way to go until it's finished) so I bought my ship and left the game to cook.\nMeanwhile Elite: Dangerous was a very similar beast but the big thing that sold me was that it was playable NOW.\nNow sure, Elite has nothing on the social/online/metagame features of EvE or the planned features Star Citizen but it is a huge game with a persistent universe and online play. Good enough for me.\nSo I played the training missions with a keyboard and mouse and decided to stop there until I had a H.O.T.A.S to play with. That was a real gamechanger. Ended up getting a Thrustmaster T Flight for around \u00a340.\nI spent about a week getting to grips with how the game worked and then left it alone for ages after hitting a bit of a brick wall. (I thought missions on the bulletin board was the best way to make money, so you can imagine my frustration when trying to save up credits)\nA couple of weeks ago my friend got an Oculus Rift DK2, so I just had to set up Elite with it to test it out and holy shit is it amazing in VR. The game is exactly perfectly right for the platform and I am 100% getting a VR device when the technology is a bit more mature.\nThe point being this experience got me into the game properly and this latest community goal has been insanely profitable for me.\nIn a few days I've gone from my Freagle and Harmless ranking through to a Cobra III and all the way up to the point where I'm sitting in an Imperial Courier with about 10 million credit's worth of upgrades, got a combat rank of Master and am in the top 15% of contributors to the Empire for the event.\nSome lessons I've learned:\nStay away from Elite Anaconda pilots unless you outnumber them 4:1 or have a ship with a stronger hull than the paper ones that come with the Courier.\nThere's an element of luck to the Combat Zones. Sometimes you'll be able to pick off all the enemies in a cluster, then move with your friendlies to the next cluster, rinse and repeat, picking up greater numbers of friendlies as you go. Other times you'll jump into the zone and have two Pythons and an Anaconda gang up on you and shred your shield in a minute.\nWhen your shield gets close to running out and you're out of shield cells, get the fuck out of dodge. That 70,000cr Anaconda voucher isn't worth paying your insurance and losing all your other vouchers with it.\nIn short after a few false starts I'm fully in love with the game for what it is and what it's shaping up to be with the expansion.\nHere's to further exploring the Milky Way with you guys."], "title": ["My experience getting to grips with the game."], "type": ["THREAD"]}

Consequently this may perhaps alleviate some of the confusion some \"I am happy\" CMDRs could have, about what gameplay depth \"I am bored\" CMDRs are looking for in-game.\n\u00a0\nPlease try to be concise with your thoughts and ideas, so that others (including FDev) can easily understand what you're after.  Provide links-to and quotes-of posts you (or others) have already made if you find that easier, including content from the \nDesign Discussion Archive\n if appropriate.\nDiscussions and ideas expanding on \nwhat we already know is coming during Horizons\n is of course welcomed.\nWhile I welcome any and all ideas, I would recommend separating different idea-subjects into different posts, as this should make make discussion branches easier to follow.  So if you've ideas about station ownership and player-to-player trading, please create two posts to be discussed separately.\nMeta-wise, please upvote/downvote posts accordingly as per \nReddiquette\n, but as this thread is flagged Serious, there should be very little to downvote.\n\u00a0\nFor example, don't simply state \"player owned stations\" but instead describe:\ngameplay mechanics on how stations could be bought/captured/constructed/destroyed/etc\nextra gameplay mechanics said stations could give when owned\nhow the station ownership can be accessed by open/group/solo players either equally or balanced\nthe ease with which the station ownership could be added, based on already existing mechanics where possible\n\u00a0\nTL;DR: What I'm hoping to avoid are context-less comments & opinions like \"SCBs ruin combat\"/\"FDev will never do that\"/\"the game is brilliant anyway & doesn't need that\", and instead get some quality conversation going about great gameplay that could be added.  This in turn may inspire FDev to develop these new gameplay mechanics that'll benefit CMDRs and the game alike.\n\u00a0\nHi \n/u/EdwardLewis_Frontier\n, lots of excellent ideas appearing here, hopefully some of them appeal to Sandro & his design team :)\n\u00a0\nEdit: typos & dev poke"], "title": ["[Serious] What game mechanics & extra gameplay depth would you like added to ED in the future?"], "type": ["THREAD"]}
