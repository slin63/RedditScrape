Making skills useful or somewhat competitive with others IS NOT POWER CREEP.  Power creep is unbalancing of a game due to successive releases of new content.  So power creep would be adding new skills that were vastly superior to old skills and bringing the old skills up to the new skill level.\nUltimately people fail to realize that the closed beta didn't accomplish much in terms of skill balance, aside from basically destroying skills like ball lightning.\nAll of the popular meta builds have 1 thing in common, they scale well with investment of money, they can build tanky and they can deal with the changes to leech and other newer map mods.\nSpells in particular (aside from incinerate) were nerfed considerably from many aspects, only later to be nerfed even harder with additional map mods added later.\nOverall I'm pretty displeased the game is in the position it is now.  People make it out that somehow there is more diversity then before, but at least in previous patches you had the option to do whatever spell you want, whatever ranged attack you wanted and could even do melee if you absolutely wanted to.  Were they subpar compared to burning the whole screen, sure, did they have downsides that you could build around, for the most part yes.  The old AA allowed for any caster that invested into mana regen to also gain bonus defenses, casters weren't so starved to actually cast their abilities.  Ranged characters like crit bow are about the same as before, little weaker due to CWDT nerf, but still enjoyable.  Melee got actually fixed, which is fine.\nI don't think a lot of people actually like the idea of playing meta builds.  PA, incinerate, SRS, cyclone and EA are probably the top 5 builds in the patch, if you aren't playing one of these in HC you are putting yourself at such a disadvantage it doesn't actually feel good to play the game.    I don't think any of them are really too powerful as they require significant cost investment in order to scale to do great damage.  The largest downside of these builds is they don't actually work in parties together, aside from 2-3 srs characters to maybe chain vaal haste.  Synergies have really been hurt a lot in 2.0 IMO."], "type": ["COMMENT"]}

Confirmation bias, probably.  Let's expand.  Because see, the thing is that the nature of the shovels and monsters and dirt are not completely out of anyone's control.  Rather, there is a third party (GGG) that has absolute power over every faucet of their being. This party makes grandiose claims about how you can use any implement you want to dig with equal speed and depth, and this draws in an awful lot of people to the dig site.  But then we get to the site and start digging, only to discover that these claims are a little bit bullshit.  Not only are shovels clearly better than monsters, but whenever people discover a breed of monster that works especially well and can rival shovels, the third party goes and \"rebalances\" the monster, or the nature of the soil or the digging process, and we're left back with only a few good choices again.  So we rally together and argue for the expansion of viable digging techniques, only to have a core group of the less creative diggers start tearing us down because they have no problem just grabbing up the same old shovels again and again and believe that we should do the same.  We defend ourselves against said uncreative diggers, but the third party in control of everything is on the uncreative diggers' side (it makes it easier and cheaper for the third party to just stand behind their unquestioning fanatics) and so we get blamed for being \"hipsters\" and then front page Reddit posts show up about how we're real jerks for being upset that we can't dig holes with awesome monsters the way we were told we could when we first showed up to dig.\nAnd that's the problem here."], "type": ["COMMENT"]}

Right now it's Poe. I guess what initially drew me to path of exile instead was the sheer number of skills available, and all of the different ways the skills interact with the supports. I'm still having a lot of fun trying out different builds with different supports, so I keep coming back. Every time I start getting bored, they release more skills and stuff to try out, so I guess timing played a role in that respect. \nBoth games have their upsides, poe's upside just appeals to me more at the moment "], "type": ["COMMENT"]}
