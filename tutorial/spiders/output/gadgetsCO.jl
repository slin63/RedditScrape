I've made an electromagnet with a coil before, but the coil itself was the magnet, so I'm not sure how he's using that. He says it has a 15 minute limit, so I'm guessing he's running it off of a battery.

This was a doppler radar so the output was an audio tone. It could detect cars a mile away, pedestrians from around 300m- Besides their speed, cyclists and pedestrians sounded different as you could her their arms swing in the signal so even if they carried a bag in one hand, they sounded different.\nAt close range around 40m I could pick up people's heartbeat and cars with their sound system cranked up would let me hear their music with radar.\nThe coolest part was that it could detect people behind brick walls if they moved, So i could count the number of people inside a building by  slowly pointing the dish on different parts of it.\nMy original intent was to do some automated traffic counting. I did a real time Fourier transform of the audio do get distinct objects and then some pattern recognition to classify and measure the speed on everything on the road.
