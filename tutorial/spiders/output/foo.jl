People don't realize that the US is so sprawled out that it's impossible to get around without a car. Outside of a major city nothing is going to be within walking distance from anything else. And even inside most cities the public transportation just isn't there because it's too expensive to cover such sprawled out cities. Only in the handful of very dense American cities (NYC, SF, Chicago) do you find public transportation good enough to go without your own car, and in those cities a lot of people actually do go without a car."], "votes": ["3878"], "type": ["COMMENT"], "hyperlink": ["https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/3p03f5/americans_of_reddit_whats_something_that_america/cw2btxc"]}
