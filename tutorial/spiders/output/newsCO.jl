Publishing a paper with negative results can destroy a career: \nArpad Pusztai was a leading researcher in lectins. He found that one type of transgenic potato- one that had was for research and never hit the market- had decidedly poor effects on the stomach mucosa of rats. This was not an entirely unexpected effect: the potato had Galanthus (snowdrop) lectin genes in it, and we know that this lectin affects pests. That it also affected rats wasn't exactly... novel, but it probably would derail the use of this lectin in potatoes. Again, the potato never went to market.\nThe growth of the rats was stunted, their immune systems were suppressed. Unfortunately, he did interviews before the paper was published, and the outfall was catastrophic. Pusztai and his wife had published ~270 papers and three books on the subject of lectins; he was a very careful scientist- up until the interview.\nEventually, his work was published in \n with triple the usual number of reviewers; five (of six) were in favor of publication; Professor John Pickett of the Institute of Arable Crops Research objected.

Most unfortunate for those who were involved, and it could have been handled better by all parties. Instead of providing an opportunity to find out if Galanthus lectin is truly damaging to the mucosal lining of rats (which is really not all that much of a stretch, given how nasty lectins can be), it turned into a huge political mess, ruining the careers of Pusztai and his co-author Stanley Ewen, and serving as a \"chilling effect\" on potentially adverse reactions to research on lectins in transgenic foods."], "type": ["COMMENT"]}

What I can say is, I don't think people are looking at all that is at play here.  We have become a society of reactionary people, people can be fired because of the internet's response to a video. We also have a lot more cameras out there, everyone has one at all times in public, and I don't think these police actions are a new thing, I think they are a old thing, but the check has finally come in and they have to pay for it. I am a criminal Justice student, and I believe I am a little more level headed then some of these officers we have seen, but it makes me pretty nervous that if the internet does not like the way I protect myself or someone else, I can loose my job, go to jail, death threats the whole deal. It is easy to watch a video 15 times and say..hey I he should of done this or that, what is not easy is deciding when someone is going to be dumb enough to try and hurt you or I. Being a police officer is not  being a hero, its not signing up to get beat and not protect yourself. I don't hear anything like this on reddit lately, and every third news article is police messing something up.   "], "type": ["COMMENT"]}

The problem is the existing laws aren't getting enforced.\nWe can see the end results of the government not really caring here:\nThere's been a ten year decline in federal firearms convictions and it's not because the laws are too loose - it's because they aren't a priority.   Here's the thing, man - felon in possession of a firearm is a federal crime.  It carries a penalty of 10 or so years, and fines in the tens of thousands.  Chicago seized something like 6,000 guns from criminals in the last year, and federal prosecutors tried only about 1% of those seizures.  Every law on the book doesn't matter if you are unwilling to use them.  People getting arrested for murder have something like 6-10 prior arrests before they get hit with the \"serious\" charge, but it's getting to be a joke.\nFor those who want to defend the ATF, instead of trying to change the subject and divert blame, it's time for you to admit that you don't know what you are talking about."], "type": ["COMMENT"]}

They might, if they're small time no name players. But with the big players, they have no problem sweeping real world transgressions under the rug. Ray Rice is the perfect example of this. He committed a crime which would land a normal person in jail, and certainly would've suspend (if not indefinitely, then at least a whole season) a non-superstar. But Ray Rice makes the NFL metric dick tons of money. So the fact that he knocked his fianc\u00e9 unconscious in an elevator and dragged her through a casino is overlooked. Which is another funny part of why this man was fined: he was fined for trying to raise awareness and bring help to victims of domestic violence, because his mother was killed by just that. But the NFL fines him. To me, that says the NFL only cares more about awareness (if you can even call it that) than it does about a solution. It's the same thing with the pink everything. They just want money, that don't care if they find a cure to cancer. \nTl;dr: The NFL is a money hungry organization that doesn't give a shit about breast cancer or domestic violence, they just care about making money "], "type": ["COMMENT"]}

Still, I'm going to preface this by saying I think that it was decided incorrectly.\nFirst, you have to realize that Meshal (the citizen) was suing individual agents \n, not the FBI or the US government. This changes the lawsuit significantly because Meshal is not alleging that what the FBI did to him was illegal, but that \n The difference may seem small, but makes a big difference. On top of that, the plaintiff is suing for money damages, not that the agents committed a crime.\nStill, that doesn't mean the agents are automatically off the hook. Keep in mind that unless a crime has to actually have been committed in order for someone to sue; just because something seems \"wrong\" doesn't mean there's a valid cause of action. Generally speaking, for federal lawsuits against government agents for money damages, either a federal statute (Federal Tort Claims Act) has to have been violated or there has to be something called a \n action. The former isn't applicable here.\nA \n action essentially alleges that the agents themselves, NOT the agency or government as a whole, violated the plaintiff's Fourth, Fifth, Eighth, or Fourteenth Amendment rights. The rationale behind \n actions has evolved such that suits for money damages has to \"represent the best way to implement a constitutional guarantee [of rights].\" (\n In \n, the Court decided that Congress has the power to determine whether a suit for money damages was the best way to implement a constitutional guarantee of rights. The rationale makes some sense; generally speaking, the legislature should be the ones to determine what is a crime and how it should be punished, not the judiciary.\nThen to add to that, there has been a slew of cases where the Court hesitates to allow \n actions where there is a \"new context\" not already covered by \n or its related cases. Given that this case implicates national security, where the judiciary shows considerable deference to the Executive and Legislative (properly imo due to separation of powers doctrine), as well as actions done outside of the US, it's clearly a \"new context.\" Thus, this appeals court's hands are tied. In the face of a ton of Supreme Court precedent, as well as legislative silence, there's nothing they can do. The court's opinion concludes by addressing the Supreme Court and Congress to \"specify the scope of the remedy.\""], "type": ["COMMENT"]}

One of the biggest problems the industry as a whole faces is labour - when you're paying minimum wage or just above you're going to get some employees like this. If they start doing background checks, pay higher wages, etc to attract a higher-calibre worker, food prices go up and the market responds negatively. As great as free-range, organic, non-factory farmed products sound, there is still a large proportion of the population who don't care enough to pay a premium.\nDon't get me wrong, I think events like this are despicable and the employees involved should be immediately fired and an investigation should take place into how / why management practices didn't prevent this in the first place.

Because four times as many of the black drivers had contraband, the popo were \n as likely to want to search a stopped black driver. The resulting relative prevalence (four times as likely to have contraband, five times as likely to be searched) gives a \n prevalence of 0.8. But that doesn't mean that they found less contraband from the stopped black drivers who the searched; it is high rates of contraband that causes even higher rates of searching.\nAnd remember, the fairness question is not about whether blacks or whites \n are more or less likely to be criminals, or more or less likely to be searched; the question is about the dividing line between someone suspicious enough to search and somene who is innocent-looking enough to send away. The \n suspicious people they search are far more likely to have contraband than the \n suspicious people. Fairness and effectiveness in police tactics is when (considering only contraband/no contraband, ignoring for the moment seriousness of contraband and other reasons to search cars) the \n suspicious black dude who gets searched and the \n suspicious white dude who get search are equally likely to have contraband. The averages of the two groups could still be very different (even completely different) because the most suspicious parts of the population are different, even though the least suspicious suspects are the same.

Their CEO made $4.3 million in 2012 (last reported date). Just as a very rough estimate, let's say 25% of their employees work in the abbatoirs. The other 75% do things like drive trucks, work in marketing, etc. No idea how accurate that is, I just picked it off the top of my head and I suspect that 25% is actually on the low side. But, if we were to take the CEO's entire $4.3 million salary and distribute it amongst the 25% of Tyson workers who actually work in the abbatoirs, each worker would get an extra $149.56 per year.

We hear about something really egregious, check it out and come to the conclusion that \"cops are bastards\". \nWell no doubt that's true at times, but Ferguson burned and a cops life was ruined in part with the help of people who after the fact recorded things, but not one video shows the cop doing anything wrong. Oh we might \"just know\" it, but we don't.\nLikewise few people get something from beginning to end, but they do manage to record the culmination of events without context, and reddit  and youtube explode.\nNow if you are a cop and you are doing your job properly and force us justified, that doesn't protect you one bit. In fact it makes you a scapegoat personally, and \"well you have to take the heat for other police action\". I think that's bullshit. Anyone doing something wrong should be punished harshly, without doubt, but that's not how we react. We want blood and aren't really interested in the facts. So what would anyone in the situation who has a remote sense of self preservation do? Less than might be warranted for fear of being ruined as has happened.\nThat's why we need every single officer to have bodycams which cannot be turned off for their entire shift and that data downloaded to a remote and redundant data storage facility which no officer can edit or delete. That gets the whole thing from beginning to end and if someone tries to get even for imagined wrongs there's a better source to go to.  "], "type": ["COMMENT"]}

There were no injuries reported.\nTwo F-16 fighter jets were scrambled from Atlantic City, New Jersey, and tracked the blimp's course. The blimp was holding at around 16,000 feet over Wilmington, Pennsylvania, NORAD said in a statement at around 2 p.m.\nThe fighter jets were armed but did not shoot the blimp down, NORAD said. The tail section detached first, and was found about a quarter-mile from where the rest of the blimp landed, officials said.\nGround controllers at Aberdeen Proving Ground do have the ability to deflate the helium-filled blimp, which could then slowly descend to the ground, but wasn't immediately clear whether that system was used, officials said.\nThe dragging tether caused power outages as it drifted over Pennsylvania, Gov. Tom Wolf's office said in a statement. Power company PPL Electric reported that 30,000 people lost power due to the drifting balloon, and by Wednesday afternoon 15,000 remained without electricity.\nThe drifting blimp was an odd sight to residents in the flight path. Sylvia Hock and her 9-year-old son, Aidan, were getting out of their car at their Millville home when they spotted the blimp.\n\"We thought it was going to land,\" Hock said. \"We thought it was going to pop it got so low. We called 911, who said they were tracking it.\"\nNORAD said it worked closely with the Federal Aviation Administration to keep commercial airlines informed of the blimp's location to avoid any close calls.\nNORAD said it was still trying to determine how the blimp got loose. Officials said the tether was within weather design minimums when the blimp became detached."], "type": ["COMMENT"]}

Currently, the majority of dealers haven't been inspected in over five years. One store that was famous for selling to straw buyers went uninspected for decade, a time during which the ATF could have made ten regular inspections, and unlimited inspections for cause. \nYou could say the problem is ATF investigative resources. But there are two solutions for that which don't need this law. One, give the ATF more investigators. Two, have them pursue only the bad dealers. One dealer that they famously took all the way through the courts and finally lost was only accused of minor paperwork mixups. Not one knowing straw sale, not one missing gun, yet they tried for years to get the license pulled. \nThis bill has two purposes. One is the standard \"We're doing something\" bill that won't help anything, and the other is to end the current protections against ATF harassment through continuous inspections.

They aren't really trying to \"bust\" people as much as ferret out all aspects of the programs they see in action.  Sometimes we even hear about our CIA doing shady things to get in on the action, such as arming groups, or infiltrating groups.\nThe FBI investigates crimes, like detectives.  If the FBI feels that their investigation takes them outside the realm of the US, that doesn't mean that they don't have jurisdiction.  They can go wherever (my understanding) that their investigation takes them.  Say, for instance, Oboweye is selling drugs in Baltimore, but is using that money to run guns into Lagos.  The FBI might start investigating him in the US, but finish looking at him in Nigeria.  I am pretty sure that's how it works.  I don't think that the FBI really starts investigations extra-nationally, they just have jurisdiction if it fits into crimes that are perpetrated at some point on US soil.

This one boy, whom I had known to be emotionally disturbed from the moment I first talked to him, had a particularly rough day. He had just found out that he had not gotten into the college he was hoping to go to, and had spent the entire day sulking, and moping around. He was being very aggressive to the other kids in class when they had asked what was wrong and it got to a point where it was affecting the lesson. Our teacher had asked him to go to the counseling office, he refused. She had then asked him to go to the principles office, and he refused. \nHow did the issue resolve? Our teacher called for our campus aide and his counselor to come and have a chat with him. We were all taken to the library and continued the lesson there. When class had ended, we went back to the room and gathered the stuff we left behind. \nHe was still there, now crying and yelling but our counselor and campus aide were there to help him, not hurt him. \nNowhere did anyone in the administration think that using force to control his behavior would work. Our AP was a big, 6'3 lacrosse coach and he's called in when shit hits the fan. I've seen him pry apart two kids fighting, and watch as he tackled a kid who tried to run when we had drug dogs come into the school after being found out he had pot in his locker. They didn't call him in, and it worked out in everyone's favor. \nI can't imagine how much worse bringing a police officer would have been to help calm this guy. It seems like the school could have done so much more to combat such simple, and elementary disobedience. Not to mention he had a previous excessive force lawsuit against him, he just shouldn't have been there in the first place. This falls on the teachers, administrators and parents.

We knew who was what and what to expect of them.

It was a math class. I know I was at the front of the room to the side because I had been a little shit that day. I know I decided that ripping a loud fart would be funny as hell so I did so.\nI have never seen a 40 some year overweight man move so fast. In a instant he had me by the throat and was dragging me to the door. My feet were doing a little tip-toe tap to try and keep up. My fear went to max level as he opened the door, threw me across the hall and then grabbed me by my collar and lifted me with one arm up above his head. I can't even recall what he said because I think a little pee ran down my leg. I then was hauled to the principal and got another ass chewing. My parents got a call but they really didn't care much at all and I didn't get a punishment. Just another ass chewing. ( my raising is a whole nother story)\nI never, ever, fucked off in that class like that again. Holy shit he put the fear of god into me. He was one of the wrestling coaches and I tried out wrestling after that but it wasn't my thing. \nYears have passed, I graduated, he retired, I had him as a customer at my business for years until he passed away. We joked about the incident and I told him I deserved it. He said he may have went a little too far but was glad to see I made something of myself.\nBut that moment in math freshman year stuck with me.\nI've got kids in middle school now. I've always wondered how I would react as a parent if my kid fucked off and had the same treatment I had by a teacher. I'm sure the school would flip shit over the teacher doing it, I'm sure my wife would also.\nI'd think I would be pretty upset with my son, AND THE TEACHER....for not listening and learning from my stupid mistakes as a kid. A loooooong life of stupid mistakes through school. Holy shit I was a little fucking asshole.\nI honestly think that ass kicking I got was a wake up call for me. I would really like to have seen this whole situation from the start of class to her being hauled out, and know her history as a student and kid to know.

Pesticide are heavily studied by almost all Bee labs. I worked in a behavioral bee lab and there were a few projects on pesticides and bee behavior. I also don't know how it works with government agency work but in the private sector when we want to present our research and do anything in public with it, we need explicit approval. Without it the company would likely seek legal action and termination. In the article it says he did some media interviews on the topic of his research. I am also betting he used his title as a USDA research scientist. This would make him a mouthpiece of the agency to the public and without approval would most likely violate policy. Then you have him publishing papers on the side. Scientific research is not something you can do on the side part time, this is especially true when dealing with seasonal observation studies. You have a short season to do your work, there is no time for distraction. At the Bee lab I worked at, you would get out in the field at 7am and you would leave work between 10pm-2am, every day of the week for the entire season. \nFrom the article it looks like a researcher liked his project, but was too focused. When reassigned he continued working on his project using USDA's resources, while neglecting his assigned duties. The only thing remotely suspicious is his project reassignment. Seeing how he responded to his reassignment I would say that there very well could be a good reason for the USDA to reassign him. "], "type": ["COMMENT"]}

I had a very similar experience with my history teacher in high school, oddly enough he was also the wrestling coach.  But my perspective was a bit different.  \nI was dragged into an empty teacher's lounge, goaded into fighting him, and when I refused he then punched me in the face.  And as he left me there crying he says \"I hope you learned your lesson you pussy\".  Now was I screwing off in class?  Yes.  Should I have been?  No.  Did that warrant getting punched in the face and humiliated in the teacher's lounge?  I didn't think so.  \nMy parents didn't care and took the position many in this thread are, that being \"if you were doing what you were supposed to be doing this wouldn't have happened\".  That might have been true, but how did that justify that teacher's actions?  And that really bothered me.  For a long time actually.  The administration didn't do shit since my parents didn't seem to care. I really felt like my parents refused to stand up for me.  I felt totally invalidated over the whole ordeal.  I mean seriously, that teacher didn't do anything wrong here?  My actions weren't OK but his were?  \nDid I screw around anymore?  Well, no.  But not because I learned my lesson or had a sudden epiphany that catapulted me out of the dumb teenager phase, rather it was because I realized this teacher could do whatever he wanted and get away with it, and there's nothing I could do about it.  It was fear that kept me from screwing off.  And he knew it too.  That's what was worse.  I remember feeling a real sense of helplessness, despair and total humiliation going back into that douche bags class everyday for the rest of the year.  I'm really not sure what I learned from the whole thing other than a total loss of respect for authority figures.\nI'm not sure what I'll do if I'm ever faced with this situation with my kids, but I know I won't do what my parents did.

Did the teacher perhaps use a volatile statement? Sure and it was definitely a mistake on her part to do so, but the teacher herself is a Christian. \nThe major problem here is the parents using their kid for publicity or accepting their kid's statement as 100% fact with zero independent verification of their own. Is it any wonder why no one wants to teach? You either get inner city thugs who could not care less about learning or you get little Johnny or Jenny snowflake whose parents are ultra-involved yet don't actually discipline their child so everything is the teacher's fault when the kid fails.

Therefore, the court case must happen where the crime was committed.\nFor comparison, suppose 2 Americans move to England and work there for a few years, and one of them kills the other. This is considered a crime in England, despite involving only Americans, and the murderer will face court and jail in England.\nThe oddity of this case is that a federal body is the defendant, which may change the situation somewhat. If he started in the US and then the agents took him overseas, he would have part of the case in US federal courts - probably something like kidnapping, and maybe the torture could be tried in US court too if he was forced overseas against his will. There would need to be some precedent to justify the application of US jurisdiction to argue for this.\nSo, its not necessarily that the court is arguing for national security over human rights; they are telling him that he can't sue in the US for a crime that was outside the US.

And another: a teacher's husband came to the school with a gun right one afternoon classes let out and was forcing her out. They didn't have an SRO but they had a security camera, and someone in the office spotted the gun and called the cops.

You have to take the time to talk over the issue with them and help them understand for themselves why texting in class is hurting their long term chances to get as much as possible out of their education, graduate, get a good job, and take care of the kids they hope to have (or may already have).\nThe real question is: why are teachers and school resource officers using physical force, punishment, and legal intimidation to control student behavior?\nThe answer is that they feel terrified and backed into a corner by all this No Child Left Behind bullshit. If a student is ruining their own chance at a good future by not paying attention and doing their work, then the teacher easily can reach out with compassion and help the student get back on track, but \n (say, by firing teachers whose students don't score well on standardized tests), then that policy converts the student's off task misbehavior into a major personal attack on the teacher. They are costing their teacher his or her job by texting in class, and once students and teachers start to see each other as enemies rather than allies, all is lost.\nAll laws and policies that make teachers' jobs contingent upon student test performance need to be repealed immediately for the sake of teachers \n students."], "type": ["COMMENT"]}

This law is designed to distract people from the fact that background checks will have absolutely no impact on these mass shootings and little if any impact on greater gun crime. As anyone who understands the laws in place will notice, dealers only have the tools that federal and state background check services provide them, and they cannot be considered liable if they've done their due diligence.\nIf a single gun shop is responsible for selling a bunch of guns used in crimes it's an indictment of the background check process as much or more than it is an indictment of the shop's policies or intent.

They show no respect for anyone because people have allowed them to get away with whatever they want.  I'm 29; if I ever pulled this kind of shit when I was in high school and the cop had done that to me, my parents would have gone up to the officer, shook his hand and thanked him for teaching me a lesson, and then have come down on me so hard I wouldn't dare mouth off or disrespect anyone every again.  I suggest her parents do the same thing to her instead of hurriedly trying to file a lawsuit and pulling the race card like I'm sure they will if they haven't already.\nThis girl was asked by several different people in several different ways to knock off the crap and get out and she, being the self-entitled brat she is, decided to show school officials zero respect and declined to leave.  They actually had to get a police officer because of her brazen disregard for the rules and even then she refused to get up and leave, at which point she was disobeying a lawful command and trespassing on school grounds, giving the officer the right to forcefully remove her.  She decided then to swing at the officer when he began to forcefully restrain her, and we all know you never EVER take a swing at a cop.  I have zero sympathy for someone like her who shows no respect to anyone because she feels she is above the rules.  She's not a special snowflake and she should not be treated differently than anyone else.  Now she'll know that being an asshole will have consequences.\nAnd it's so easy to second-guess what an officer should have done from behind a computer screen and in the safety of your homes.  You have no idea what it would be like in that situation or how you would react.  Easy to Monday morning quarterback a situation that you have no experience with or have ever been in.  I'm not saying violence should be the first option, but a police officer is left with few tools at his or her disposal when it comes to people who resist their commands.\n Wow reddit gold! My first!

I was taught by teachers who knew how to manage their own classrooms. In my final year (when the cop showed up), teachers knew how to deal with situations and the cop was rarely seen actually working. The teachers had control of each and every situation. But here we have a teacher who cannot deal with a disobedient student, an administrator who cannot deal with the student and an officer who cannot control himself.\nWas the student disrespectful, disobedient and a distraction? Sure. But that does not mean we should ignore the CLEAR lack of training these adults we entrust children with have."], "type": ["COMMENT"]}
