Not that my family was ever very religious, but we went to church on Sundays and high holidays until I was a teen. I never questioned it just began to believe there was a God until I began to mature. \nAs I entered my teens I started seeing the hypocrisy of the church members. The gossiping, the judging of the poor or unkempt. The cliques that divided along class lines or which school the people went to. \nThen one of my first girlfriends was very religious. Came from a very devout family active in their Baptist church. Came to find out that her sister was kicked out of Baptist College for premarital sex. Then that she'd had an abortion with the boyfriend prior to me. THEN that her mom had fooled-around with someone in the church.\nI stopped thinking of churchgoers as any better than other people pretty quick. Even though they were good and nice people they were total hypocrites who continued to judge others for the same behaviours. \nSo then I started really questioning. What sort of logic does this system make anyway. Only the devout born into specific areas were 'saved.\" Sucks to be you, guy who was born in rural Japan. You didn't hear about Jesus so you get to burn. Oh, you died without being baptised? You're evil and are going to burn. \nI started to decide that maybe this God guy was a pretty big asshole. \nThen I started college and began to be really educated. Learning deeper about science and history and other cultures. Wait, how does any of this make sense with an omnicient being that can do anything. It doesn't reconcile. \nSo slowly I began realizing. I don't believe in a God. Certainly not one that we've been sold on.\nOn my most theistic day I'll say, \"Well, maybe the fundamental forces of the universe can be called \"God\" but it's certainly not some anthropomorphised guy who's got my back.\" It MOST certainly isn't a Jewish Zombie who is his own father, nor a wolf who split a gord open nor the son of a Titan who killed his dad and fucked his own sister.

(11pm-7am) One night during the winter I got a call from a room about screaming from the floor below them. Our hotel is only 6 stories high. They were on the 5th floor so that means the room they were complaining about was on the 4th floor because it's set up as Ground floor-1st-2nd-3rd-4th-5th. I said I would check it out for them and I was kinda of reluctant because as an audit, i'm the only worker in the whole building at night. Before I went up though, I looked in the system to see if there was any rooms near them so that I could narrow it down. Here's the creepy part for me. It was in the winter so there wasn't many people in the building. In fact there wasn't any rooms near the one of the fifth floor and there wasn't a single guest staying on the fourth. I went up and investigated but the room directly under the other guests door was wide open which should be impossible being it uses a key card system. Thinking it was just left open by housekeeping I looked in there to see if anyone was in there and closed the door. I told the guests from the fifth floor that it must have just been some kids running down the hall. An hour later they said they heard screaming again and banging below them. I went up there and the door was open again. At this point it was a security concern because someone has access to a room they shouldn't have. So I decided to watch the security footage from the fourth floor. In the video, the door clearly opens. Most freaky thing I have ever seen. I wrote a ticket to maintenance to check the door in the morning and they said it was fine. I showed the video to my boss and he was freaked out too. We ended moving the guests to the other side of the building because they were spooked. To add on to this, when maintenance went in there to check the door before they opened it, they heard banging in the room. When they came in the screen door to the balcony was wide open. I don't really believe in paranormal stuff but no one could explain what happened and from then on I have been really hesitant at night to go up to the 4th floor on my rounds. My manger ended up filing a incident report just to have on the records. "], "type": ["COMMENT"]}

This is going to be very, very long)\nTo explain, this started back before 2005. I was raised catholic, but went to a Christian church with friends families whenever I could. I prayed, I did my best not to sin but prayed for forgiveness when I did. I did nice things for people, I tried to be good and do good. One year, my best friend Mandy was diagnosed with a brain tumor. She was deteriorating, and I and every one of her friends and family prayed for her. Upon surgery, she died on the table. I was broken, she was my best friend, but I truly felt God needed her and had better plans for her. I forgave it. I prayed harder. I studied  the bible. I brought friends with me to church to spread His word. I devoted myself harder to being good in the eyes of God.\nWhen I was 12-13, my father was getting sicker and sicker, had to make weekly visits to get a needle through his back to drain his lungs of fluid. His liver was failing. His kidneys were failing. His lungs were collapsing. He was diagnosed with Sarcoidosis and it attacked nearly every vital organ. He spent so much time hooked up to machines. We spent Thanksgiving and Christmas in the hospital. My fafher, the most loving and influential and important man in my life, an amazing human being, the light of many people's lives, a literal lifesaver of few, wonderful husband, devoted father of two. And here he was. Despite me praying, begging, sobbing, falling on my knees every chance I could to God to please, don't take him. Help him. He has done nothing but good in his life. I need him. This world needs him. Please, please don't take my daddy.\nAfter months and months of agony, hospital stays, being hooked up to machines to the point he could not talk or move, being stabbed with large needles, injected with drugs, missing his family and his life, knowing death was looking over him, he went into congestive heart failure, among every other organ being turned into granuloma tissue. He was rushed to a nearby facility, he was bumped up to the top of the list for an immediate heart transplant. But he didn't make it. He died in the ambulance on the way there.\nThis is where my faith faltered. Why didn't he help us? My father was an amazing human being. I prayed with all of of my heart. I was devoted. I fell to my knees in my back yard every day, speaking out lout to god and sobbing for things to be okay. I prayed every night, morning, and every chance I thought about it. I was trying to be good in God's eyes so he could see I meant it and needed it.\nMy life fell apart, and I considered suicide. Weeks of contemplating led up to me one day writing out my notes to my Mom, Sister, and one good friend I had. I took a bottle of sleeping pills, and a bottle of OTC painkillers and a bottle of vodka and sat in my kitchen while my family was visiting other family for the night.\nI asked God one more time. Give me a sign. Let me believe. I trusted you. I had faith. I devoted years of my life to pleasing you. Do this for me. Give me a sign, help me, save me. I'm lost and I'm about to give my life back to you. \nI know it was stupid to expect something, but I was desperate. And nothing happened. The only thing that pulled me out was my dog laying her head in my lap and pushing my tear-soaked face up from between my knees.\nTo make matters worse, my dog passed away one year to the day of my father's passing. Ain't that a bitch. Like a final \"hey, fuck you, lady!\"\nSo my views on God and religion may be twisted in believing that he can can save people and shit, but this is my experience and my reasoning. And I'm not changing it unless God personally gives me a reason to. I'm done with faith. I'm believing in my self and my own good morals from here on out."], "type": ["COMMENT"]}

An influential member of my home church was found to have developed a very painful, aggressive cancer. Our church pooled all of our resources to send him to get the best care on the other side of the country. We prayed every service. We even had several days where we would have 24 hour prayer services, just for him and his family (wife and four year old daughter). We clung to the verse in Hebrews that talks about how the prayer of one devout man shut the heavens in drought for seven years and then opened them when he prayed. We were devout. I know I was. I walked the walk. I was as pure as they come. But you know where this story is going. \nHe died. In fact, today is his birthday. Despite all of our prayer he died. I was left to conclude that either 1. God saw his death as being of more service than his life... so why pray, 2. Not a single person in my church, including me was devout enough to move God's hand... so why pray, and 3. there was no God to move... so why pray. What's strange is that I settled on number two, believing that everyone must be a hypocrite and that I had some kind of sin in my life that prevented God from hearing me. My prayer life took a major hit after that, but I was still a Christian for a few more years until reason finally won out.  "], "type": ["COMMENT"]}

No info other than female screams and an address. \nWe roll in to the parking lot and kill the lights, waiting for LE to arrive and clear the scene before we go in. Maybe 10 seconds after putting the truck in park we see a woman coming running out of a motel room with a towel wrapped around her. As she's making her way down the stairs, a guy comes running after her, with a towel, but in more of an \"I'm sorry!\" run than a \"get back here, bitch!\" style, if that makes sense. \nCops pull in right as she's making her way to a car across the parking lot and he's yelling \"Wait! Wait!\", and give us the all clear to begin care. \nTurns out they were both having an affair, and decided to try some anal beads. Instead of pulling them out slowly and gently, he, in her words, \"Ripped them out like I'm a fucking chainsaw or something\". \nYeah... Terrible night, for the both of us. Her more than myself.

That room is the darkest part of college and there were no windows. I grab my stuff and nope the fuck out of there.\nI commented this situation with my friends and they told me that at night there's a guy who goes there to shave the male corpse's beards.

The thought of losing my parents forever one day was terrifying. I \n \n, and spent a year or so in terrible anxiety searching for any hint of anything devine. From mystic poetry to quantum physics, I looked everywhere. It was like trying to nail jello to the wall. Which is also a decent metaphor for wave-particle duality.      \nWhich brings me to the next point...\nI wanted to find religion, in a dogmatic way. With some certainly I could hold on to. But it just wouldn't stick. Then one day I just accepted that I'll live the rest of my life bewildered. And I could either continue to rage against it, or embrace it. \nIt helped when I asked my grandpa about what he believes happens after death (it would seem like a weird thing to ask an elder, but he's more comfortable with it that I can understand right now), he said: \"I don't know. And anyone who tells you they do is lying.\"  \nSo, for several years now I've been working on embracing the wild, perplexing weirdness that is life.

To relax enough so that you're not distraught by the idea that this sandcastle partly you're having on the beach with your loved ones will be washed away one day. But not so much that you become a nihilist and just say \"fuck it.\"\nIt's a balance to strike sometimes, but it's getting more effortless. \nThis is not to say you can't be agnostic theist. In which case, there being intention in the creation of universe is your null stance. Though I'm not sure if you pick it, or if it's an existential response to living life.\nTL;DR: It's hard being an agnostic sometimes. But it doesn't ever feel like a choice.

I simply could not understand, how does a person benefit from being frightened of changes and new ideas. It seems that our society moves forvard just because of bold implementation of new ideas.\nI asked this, because I had just scored very high on openness in the Big Five model of personality traits and the psychologist had told me that no set of personality traits is inherently better than other. Took me down from the happy state of \"I have won a prize in personal traits lottery!\".\nShe told that society seems to operate optimally when there is a large base of conservative people, who hold things stable, so that the very adaptive and the very maladaptive, who both exist, can live comfortably and give their contribution to society. \nWhen I thought about it, it makes sense. Large set of curious and ever-changing people can do harm, if the benefits of some change have not been tested.

I didn't believe he gave us a brain capable of examining evidence for no reason. \"Love the Lord your God with all your Mind.\"\nHowever, the more I delved into the theology, the more I found myself having to do mental gymnastics to justify God's actions. A friend asked me 'What the difference was between justice and hitting back', taking into context eternal damnation. I couldn't think of an answer that fully satisfied me for that question.\nAs I started software engineering, I started to get this sense of when a piece of software was way over-complicated and needed to be excised and replaced with a simpler interface. Once I was in the stride of my new career, I received the first explanation I had of evolution that made sense. It was coherent and the fact it could be used to make predictions on animals and fossils we eventually found made me decide it was likely correct.\nUnfortunately evolution is at odds with Christian theology, no matter how hard people try to make them mesh. If God's reason for introducing death and suffering in the world is due to the sin of Adam and Eve-- if Jesus's sacrifice is meant to cover this original sin and all others-- we suddenly have a huge problem if evidence points toward death being there from the very beginning, far before we evolved. God's justification for how he handles sin makes no sense then. We never had a chance to make the right decision. 'Evil' was always there-- we didn't introduce it. We weren't responsible. He was.\nAnd then I felt that creeping feeling at the back of my neck like it was time to excise a piece of over-complicated software..."], "type": ["COMMENT"]}

The rent from the other units paid my mortgage, taxes and insurance and netted me about an extra $1000 per month.  I was making decent money in my job but wasn't completely  comfortable but after buying the house I suddenly had decent disposable income.  The unit I moved into was 1800 ft\n and needed the most work and I spent the next 2 years doing a front to back renovation.  \nShortly after I bought the house the market started to heat up and within 5 years I had over $200k in equity in the building and my rents were now netting me close to $2k/month.  Future long term decisions about my job and career were now easier to make.  I no longer needed to stay at a job that I didn't like.  I could be choose where I wanted to work.  Eventually I used some of the equity to open my own business that now has $1.5M in annual revenue.   I no longer have the property, as it took a hit in the 2008 crash (I sold it for what was owed from the refi mortgage) but by this time the property had served its purpose.  Without making that purchase and listening to my friend who suggested that I buy a multi-family I don't think I get to where I am today.  \nEdit: clarity"], "type": ["COMMENT"]}

You can cut through that bullshit instantly and get right to the truth. \nBetfair is one of the most popular websites for betting on elections, and they are unquestionably the most accurate predictor of winners and losers in US elections. \nDon't believe me?

The Bible promotes a lot of guilt or, conversely, gratitude for your salvation. It's a constant struggle of knowing you are not perfect, feeling bad for it, and then feeling thankful for being \"saved.\" Around 17 I started to wonder why, if God was omnipotent and omniscient, he created a race of beings who were both doomed and designed to fail and then staged a whole gruesome sacrifice production to \"save\" us. Something about the passion of the christ didn't touch me the way it touched my fellow Christians -- God was the one who insisted on absolving our sins in such a grisly way, so why should I feel terrible that he went through that to save me? If he was really omnipotent and merciful, then why didn't he just \n send us to hell for sins we were doomed to commit? Why should I feel bad or guilty anyway for doing things that it was in my nature to do?\nNone of that added up to me. \nBeyond that, I started looking into the history of Jesus and the resurrection, and there were no secular eyewitnesses, only Christians. Although it's hard to understand why the disciples would have made up the story of the resurrection, it's also hard for me to believe why the resurrected Christ would not have appeared to non-Christians to prove that he had resurrected to everyone. I wondered why the salvation of humankind should be predicated on blind faith in an event that happened in one region at one point in history and was only witnessed by a small group of people. It seemed like God, if he existed, was trying to hide himself from most of humanity.\nThe nail in the coffin for me was watching Cosmos and reading an article about the vastness of the universe (around the same time). Although I had heard most of the information before, I was struggling with my religion at the time, so it became really pertinent for me. I suddenly realized that humans know almost nothing about anything. The amount that our intelligence has expanded over the past 5,000 years is ridiculous, and the amount of things that we still don't know is also ridiculous. I realized there was just no way to know if there is a God and if so, what religion he is part of.\nI became agnostic, because there are still some spiritual experiences I've had that I suspect are real. I still feel in my gut that there is something more out there. I just don't pretend to know what it is anymore."], "type": ["COMMENT"]}

I certainly appreciate the hell out of it.\nI think that economic inequality is absolutely part of the answer and I agree with you. I think economic inequality goes nowhere and is, at best, minimized as long as we keep capitalism in place. Capitalism inherently has poverty as a part of it. It is impossible to have the former without the latter but I am kind of digressing there and apologize.\nI understand your concern that you highlight with intersectionalism but if I may, as a Sociologist, I believe that you are thinking of intersectionalism a bit incorrectly but nothing egregious or anything. \nIntersectionality is just the belief, theory, thought - what have you - that it is impossible to separate out one's race or class or gender when examining oppression and marginalization and how it impacts various groups and in other ways argues that these three things are occurring at the same time as they do not and cannot exist in a vacuum. \nSure, the fractures from there, as you put it, do and will occur but it happens on the \"right\" with libertarians, tea partiers, Anarcho-Capitalists, conservatives, \"blue dog Democrats\" and all that but the idea that should unite third-wave feminists (really all feminists, actually) is the goal to strive for equality while recognizing that there are other marginalized voices that tend to be drowned out or ignored outright and that should not be acceptable.\nAlso, one last point I would like to make...The civil rights movement was a small step toward equality that seemed to largely benefit white women. Of course as I type this, I was searching for a couple articles that proved this and am coming up empty so feel free to take that with a grain of salt as I seem to have misplaced my sources.\nI don't think the Civil Rights Movement \"opened\" a pathway but they certainly moved the ball down the pathway a bit more. I think it has been the burden and responsibility of all of us who care about equality, the oppressed and marginalized, to continue to run with that ball and not be complacent.\nRegardless, I certainly appreciate your input here.

They were grey and white respectively. \nThey gave me something to wake up and care for every morning, something else to focus on. Just as I saved their lives, I credit them with saving mine. \nRats are very cool creatures!!\nBest $2 I ever spent! \nEdit: Thank you for the gold kind anonymous Samaritan.

He had invited me to his birthday party, to which I had arrived a bit earlier than the rest of the guests. In fact, the only people in attendance were the young man in question, and another boy who was introduced as being his best friend. The three of us sat on a couch in the living room as we waited for others to arrive, passing the time by staring dumbly at some television show or another.\nNothing seemed amiss in the slightest... until my new acquaintance reached over to a nearby box of tissues and extracted one. He nonchalantly blew his nose, then opened the paper folds to examine their contents.\n\"Oh, it's chunky,\" he said. He turned to his friend and held out the tissue.\n\"Awesome,\" his friend replied... then he pulled a slimy booger from the tissue and popped it into his mouth.\nThe young man turned to me. \"Want any?\" he asked. He took a pinch of greenish yellow mucus for himself and sucked it between his lips.\nI was too busy trying not to vomit to answer verbally, so I just shook my head and tried to focus on the television. Unfortunately, I could still see the two of them sharing the soiled tissue between them, like two shameless gluttons licking and slurping at the melted remnants in a candy wrapper. Since that day, there has been very little that I find quite as abhorrent as someone eating their own mucus. It may not have been the \n disgusting thing I've seen in my life, but it was the first time that I ever felt like throwing up from the sight of something alone.\nIt was also, a few moments later, the first time that I ever declined a slice of birthday cake.

They describe the machine that will make hundreds of micro cuts around your cornea; how it will flip back the top layer of your eye like a flap, so they can zap the tender eye-meat underneath it.\nThe day of the procedure, you'll feel scared and tense the entire time. They give you a xanex to help you relax, but make no mistake; you'll be awake through the entire procedure. You'll sit in the waiting room waiting for the drugs to kick in, and feeling miserable in that unique way that only 'anticipation' can make you feel.\nDuring the procedure, they'll tell you to look at the red focusing light, and try not to move your eye away from it. The implied warning is: if you move, the laser might miss its target. And by God, you'll focus on that light more than anything you've ever done in your life. And it will be super difficult. Have you ever \n staring at something without moving your eyes, even a little? It's impossible. You'll be terrified the whole time, that if you move your eye even a millimeter, it'll fuck up your life.\nYou can't close your eye; they have it wedged open with some Clockwork Orange contraption. You can't blink, and they occasionally squirt your eye with some solution to keep it moist.  Your eyelid will constantly be fighting to close, trying to escape the doctor's dark work.\nYou know what they don't tell you about, ahead of time?  The smell. You will smell burning flesh - it'll fill the room, and permeate into your sinuses.  You'll continue to smell it for days, afterward. That smell is your eyeball burning, as they make the corrections.\nThe entire thing takes 10 minutes. Then you go home, listen to some relaxing music, go to sleep, and wake up with 20/20 vision.\nOh.  My.  God.  \nTry to imagine life in high def.  Contacts and glasses don't come close to the pure joy of perfect vision.  The day after my surgery, it rained, and all sorts of little details popped out at me, as I drove to work.  I could see the bright flares of car taillights, glittering on the wet pavement.  The plain, gray stormclouds contains millions of alternating, shifting shades of blue and grey and green.  I could read fine print from across the room.  It \n changed my outlook on life.\nWas it terrifying? Yes, absolutely. Was it worth it? Yes, absolutely. It was the best money I've ever spent, and by a huge margin. I don't regret it whatsoever, and I want you to know all of the fright was just my own perception. The risks are very small. I hope you get it, and I'm sure you'll love the results.\nThat was five years ago, and I go in for a follow-up checkup every year.  Still 20/20.  No issues or complications.\n: Wow, this blew up!  As I implied above, my greatest enemy was my own head; my imagination and flair for the dramatic scared me far worse than the actual procedure, which - I should mention - was completely painless.  To clarify; looking away from that focusing light will \n screw up the surgery.  Their machines can react far faster than any human ever could, and no amount of jittery eye motion will throw it off.  The procedure took about 10 minutes, which is about 5 minutes per eye.  Meaning, they only work on one eye at a time.\n..mumble, mumble, thanks for the gold..."], "type": ["COMMENT"]}

Let's make it! Here's your budget!\n Game team, assemble!\n World-building!\n Art!\n Code!\n Oh, boy! Now to advertise!\n Ugh, this sucks.\n Now I'm sad.\nIn actuality, video game production goes much more like this:\n I have a great idea for a game!\n That's cute. Forget it. We have to close $35 million in revenue by the start of FY18. How can we do that?\n Uh, well... I guess \"Ghostbusters\" is going to be big soon?\n Fine. Let's reach out to the IP holders about a joint sponsorship deal. Go reskin something that was successful last year.\n (\n) Okay. Game team, assemble, I guess.\n Copied-and-pasted assets with a pallet-swap?\n Reused engine with most of the bugs still in it?\n Give me a bunch of cutscenes that will work well in commercials.\n Hang on, where's the writer?\n Writers have no place here. Get a junior designer to do it on his lunch break.\n Yeah, you can't put good writing in a commercial. Idiot.\n But...\n (\n) By the way, make sure the title has social media integration, and that its design would work well for Twitch streaming.\n I'll need $2 million for a team and software.\n You can have eighteen dollars and this popsicle stick.\n Why does the marketer get $20 million, then?\n (\n)\n Preorder everything!\n (\n)\n Ugh, this sucks.\n (\n)\nInterestingly enough, though, it's not \n done with malicious intent. A lot of times, some of the questionable design choices are made by one person with too much deciding power (and not enough perspective).\n Hey, so, we have this strong female lead character.\n Good, good. That's trending well right now.\n Okay. Anyway, what do you think of her voice?\n I fear no evil!\n No, no! God, no! That will never work.\n Why not?\n Our market analysis indicates that our target demographic might not respond well to a woman they can't picture themselves both dominating and nurturing.\n What.\n Here, try this.\n (\n) Oh, no... if only I had a man with orange dust on his fingers to help me...\n That's a rather archaic description of gamers, you know.\n You're right. Sorry, I was being an idiot. Here.\n Oh, no... if only I had a man to help me...\n I thought she was the lead? You know people will complain about this.\n Yesssss... they will debate it... and say our title by name!\n Got it. As of now, I am tendering my resig...\n (\n) You have bills to pay.\n ... Yes, sir.\nThe short of it is that video games are rarely made with the intention of entertaining people anymore. Personally, I've always been of the opinion that they should be enjoyable \n, and that people will pay for that experience. That's a less and less popular perspective in the upper echelons of the industry, though, and it's incredibly depressing.\nThink of the number of \n games you've heard about in the past decade. I'm talking about the ones with writing more robust than \"KILL THE DIFFERENT PEOPLE!\" gameplay more in-depth than \"DO THE EXCITING THING!\" and an environment that actually immerses you within itself.\nNow, how many \n games have you heard about?\nStill, that (UPCOMING TITLE HERE) sure looks neat, doesn't it?

I'll share an anecdote about my encounters with religion though.\nWhen I was around 10 years old a friend of mine who was Christian invited me to join him for Sunday school. The church had an awesome play ground and we got free food so I was so fucking excited. Before I could attend he asked \"do you believe in god?\", I said no. He shrugged \"would you be open to the concept of god?\", I said \"sure\". At 10 years old I didn't even understand the question, I really wanted to hang out with my friend at this wonderful play ground.\nAfter I got invited I went to my parents and asked them if I could go to Sunday school and they said yes. I asked them about why our family doesn't believe in god and they explained that it's just not important to us, but if it's something I want to pursue, then I should go for it.\nI still remember that day vividly.\nI recall turning up in my most formal clothing and sitting down in the pews with my friend. I then had to sit through what felt like hours of boring long talks and hymns. I was read the words, but the meaning was lost on me. This whole thing seemed silly. I ended up having some fun afterwards with the other children there, we ate scones and ran around the play ground while the parents were still in church.\nI remember asking my friend if this was what religion was like and he told me it was. I remember thinking \"yeah, this isn't for me\". I had fun playing with the other kids, but that other stuff was boring. Ever since then I've been I guess more of an apatheist, I couldn't care less about religion. I'm just happy playing in the playground and eating scones."], "type": ["COMMENT"]}

I was brought up in a non-religious household (my parents didn't practice any specific religion, but never guided me away from it), so any kind of religious rituals or traditions were unknown to me, it was funny the first time I had dinner at their house, the family all joined hands to say grace before eating which kind of weirded me out, having never seen it before, but that's what they did, so I did it as well (when in Rome, you know?) plus I had respect for my friend and his family, who were so nice to me. Anyhoo, he used to attend what was called \"Youth Group\", which was a thing on a Friday night at the local Church, very much like Sunday School, where the neighborhood kids would come and spend a few hours at the Church doing whatever.  \nWe had plans to go somewhere with his family for the weekend, leaving early Saturday, so I stayed over on a Friday night, and I was asked if I wanted to go to Youth Group with him, so I went along, I've always had kind of a \"Why not\" attitude.  \nIt was an interesting experience, it was a gathering of maybe 10-15 kids, and we all sat in (not the main part of the church with the pews and such) but like a back area, next to a small kitchen, kind of a room, similar to a classroom actually, there were books and puzzles, a few toys, that kind of thing, and we sat in there with the Priest (or reverend or pastor, whatever he's called) and basically chatted about life stuff and how that related to God, and how the Bible related to modern day life, and how you applied it, morality and all that. It was a pretty good experience, not preachy, no reading verses as such, and I took a fair bit away from it, I think the Priest was a fairly progressive one, I would have to imagine, after that (about an hour or so, gabbing and having snacks and cordial) we played outside in the church grounds (stuff like hide and seek, red light/green light, flash light) it was pretty fun, I'll have to admit, but It never really changed my mind on religion though, and they never tried to \"convert\" me, which I always appreciated.  \nBut yeah, so I was very similar to you, just happy playing with the kids and being with my best friend.."], "type": ["COMMENT"]}

When i was a kid, i never knew my father growing up, my mum was an alcoholic. And all i pretty much remember from my past was the numerous foster care homes i was in.\nI had a lovely old couple. They took care of my brother extremely well. Non-religious folk. Really keen on helping others. Each day they took us to school. Brought us home. It was honestly one of the better times in my life. From what i remember his wife was very ill, cancer, from what i remember. Anyhow, they always told us to believe in ourselves rather than the big man in the sky. \nA couple of months later i moved homes. Into a religious family, they were strict, forced me into going to church. When my brother refused they got mad at him and when i stepped up i got punished for it.\nOver the years, growing up. After returning to my mother she then throws me out at the age of sixteen. At the time i was lucky to have some very kind people in my life. I used to tell her and my grandparents that i felt extremely depressed. They would laugh and say that i don't know what depressed was. Although that maybe true they always laughed in my face. \nA couple of times, i prayed to the big man but he never done much for me. I always wished that maybe he would have helped me through. \nAt the end of the day, I'm homeless again crashing on my friends couch washing dishes to move out. But i just see it as I've always looked after myself, I've tried my best. Believing in that guy upstairs just isnt believable to me.\nWhat sort of god bestows poverty, famine, cancer, disease in general. Why would he make natural disasters if he loved us? \nI guess the only one in life who gets you through. Is well, you! \nSorry for horrible format. I am using a mobile"], "type": ["COMMENT"]}

She just regurgitated nonsense without any real attempt to explain it.  It got to the point where when I would ask simple logic questions pertaining to scripture and she wouldn't even attempt to pad it with loving Christianisms, she would just adopt a cold-hearted \"because that's the way it is!!\" attitude that really turned me off.  My Dad, on the other hand, was also raised Catholic but had no real personal affiliation with God or Jesus.  He was always very spiritual though, so when I would ask him these same logic questions he would respond with these much more meaningful \"gut instinct\" answers.  \nThis discrepancy was very influential in shaping how I proceeded on the topic of God.  My mom, who claimed to love the lord, couldn't even cater to my questions...not even enough to get me on her side.  My dad, who didn't really subscribe to any sort of religion or theism, gave me a heart felt response when I came to him.  I guess when I was little I attributed the callous attitude of my mother with God, and the caring spiritual attitude of my dad with the absence of God.\nFrom there it's the same old story.  I've never seen anything to make me believe in a higher power, and I don't have the same spiritual fortitude of my father to just trust everything is taken care of.

Over the years, each of the major shareholders in Brewers Retail (Labatts, Molson and Sleeman) were purchased by foreign companies (Anheuser Busch, Coors and Sapporo respectively), which has resulted in smaller Canadian craft breweries getting less shelf space at The Beer Store, and left a bad taste in many Ontarians' mouths - both figuratively and literally. \nWhen confronted with the prospect of Ontario allowing beer sales in grocery stores and convenience shops, The Beer Store established a campaign \"warning\" the people of Ontario that beer prices would surely increase as a result, and that beer would inevitably end up in the hands of \"your children\". Because competition is somehow bad for prices, and no one has ever been able to buy beer from The Beer Store underage (especially myself, many many times). \nThere's also the tax dodging that Brewers Retail has employed for years (by claiming it's run at zero profit, when they're simply sending their profits back to their foreign owners), wrapped up in the whole mess as well. I'm not going to get into it in depth, but it's really the thing that spurred things to change. So, the good news is that Ontario's current Liberal government ignored BR's pleas, and we will soon have the ability to buy six-packs from grocery stores throughout the province. In the end the Beer Store's owners win either way, since they are the ones providing most of the beer to their own competition, so they make money whether we buy beer at The Beer Store, LCBO, or Loblaws.

I had to actually leave the room while my lab partner filled up the vial, I was so close to vomiting. \nAlso, apple sauce. There's actually a story about that one. When I was little, I was taking a bath with my older brother. He went to dunk his head in the water, and for some reason I decided to bite him on the back. Well, right where I put my mouth was a huge loogie that he'd spit out earlier. The next day I was eating apple sauce, thought about the loogie incident, and related the texture of the apple sauce with the loogie. This must've been 23 or 24 years ago, and I still gag whenever I try to eat applesauce. \nAlso, bananas. I hate the way they smell. "], "type": ["COMMENT"]}

I belonged to a liberal denomination that didn't require you to believe that Bible stories were literally true. This was kind of obvious for some stories like the 6-day creation or Noah's ark. But they still taught that these were all myths or parables that had a symbolic meaning, and they were supposed to illustrate man's relationship to God. Fine, got that. So basically I believed that religion was a myth, but it was a myth invented by God, that he wanted us to believe (or at least believe as long as we were scientifically illiterate, but that we could outgrow literal belief, and graduate to a more sophisticated understanding)--because believing would make us more moral, better people.\nI should also mention that I grew up during the civil rights movement, and there was one minister in particular that I greatly admired, because he spent his personal vacation working on a voter-registration drive in Mississippi. Unfortunately there were some influential members of our congregation who were terribly racist, and were outraged by this, and started stirring up trouble for him, until he finally resigned. I was in high school at the time. This was in the early 1960's. (Yeah, I'm old.)\nThen in college, I had some long conversations with an atheist friend of mine about whether religion really made people moral. He listed all the abominations that had been committed in the name of Christianity: the crusades, witch-burning, burning of heretics, slavery, extermination or enslavement of native people, the Ku Klux Klan, etc. I didn't deny any of this; after all, I had seen examples of hateful behavior in my own church. But I said: \u201cYou can't really hold Christianity responsible for all that.\u201d He said: \u201cYes, you can.\u201d\nThat's all it took. At first I thought: \u201cHow can he think that?\u201d Then I started pondering. I pondered and pondered this problem for at least several days, maybe weeks. Eventually I figured out that I had been using the \u201cno true Scotsman\u201d fallacy (although I didn't know it was called that at the time); I had been discounting all this bad behavior on the grounds that the people committing it were not \u201ctrue\u201d Christians. But what grounds did I have for deciding that they were not \u201ctrue\u201d Christians? Only that they were behaving badly. This makes the idea that \u201cbeing a Christian makes you better\u201d a self-fulfilling prophecy. I suppose I had been studying science enough by that point to know what \u201cconfirmation bias\u201d was. Obviously, if you're going to evaluate Christianity according to how it affected people, you have to count the bad effects as well as the good effects.\nIf you evaluated Christianity objectively, and considered \n the available evidence, it wasn't even clear that it made people better more often than it made them worse. So, if God invented Christianity to make us better, why was he using a method that didn't work? If Christianity didn't work, what ground was there for believing that Christianity was created by God? And if God hadn't created Christianity, what ground was there for believing that he had created anything? Or that he even cared whether we were good or bad?

Both sides see it as so black and white and clash with each other. But both sides are inherently arguing about different issues:\nPro-life people see an unborn child as equal to a baby; alive, sentient, with a soul. So of course they see abortion as wrong. Nobody thinks killing babies is ok.\nPro-choice people see an unborn child as bundle of cells; yet to become something sentient, equal to a sperm or an egg. So of course they see abortion as a right. Nobody thinks someone shouldn't be able to do what they please to the cells that are part of their own body.\nSo it comes down to the black and white of \"Is an unborn child alive or not? Is a human a human when it is conceived? Or at some point later in development?\" Which is a near impossible question to answer.\nPro-life people see pro-choice people as justifying the killing of babies. Pro-choice people see pro-life people as trying to control how people treat their own bodies. Neither are correct, but at the same time, is their a way to prove either side wrong?\nAnyway, my 2 cents."], "type": ["COMMENT"]}

I beat the game, but it was only out of sheer stubbornness. \nWhat's funny is that my brother, who played neither 1 or 2, played 3 going in completely blind and loved it.

I think that's really what most people want, a genuine connection.\nAnyways, I have access through a paywall to loads of published journals, it's fun reading if you know how to search for stuff!\nHere's what I found:\n(you can download the full article in pdf form here: \n)\nThis article examines and tries to define intimacy. It's a pretty interesting read.\nThe real thing you're probably interested in is the actual experiment questions. I did a few google searches for it by name \"Effects of Experimentally Generated Closeness on Self and Other Neural Processing: A Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging Study A Dissertation Presented\" and unfortunately they all seem to be purchase only. \nThe end of the pay for experiment document has two types of questions; those that build intimacy, and those that don't. They're pretty good examples of exactly what you're asking.\nI did find this link:\nIt looks like you can request Sarah Ketay to share her copy with you.

We have no fucking clue. How? No idea. Where? We know where the vast majority of serotinergic neurons are but can't see how effective they are directly in a living human. So what's the response to this incredibly vague idea? Prescribe an SSRI to increase serotonin.\nThe problem with ALL mental disorders today is that we have no knowledge of the etiology or root cause of the disease, we just see that, for example, dopamine allows someone to focus and be motivated, people who have ADHD can't do either, ok maybe giving them dopamine will help. \nThis is obviously very oversimplified but it's pretty much the line of thinking in the birth of stimulants, SSRI's, and antipsychotics (too much dopamine)."], "type": ["COMMENT"]}

And yet in the end, the war that Katniss started by saving her sister ended up costing her sister's life anyways.\nBut Prim was Katniss' entire reason for being, everything she did was in the attempt to make the world a safer place for her sister. The gravity of that moment when the light of Prim's life is forever extinguished from Katniss' world should have been explored much deeper. Instead, it's basically glossed over, and we're just told in Katniss' own perspective that she's just really really sad."], "type": ["COMMENT"]}

I had no one but my mom.\nSo, I bought a white Parakeet from Petsmart for $20. I named him Snowbird. \nHe was very young when I got him. Since I didn't leave my room, he was the only one besides my mother that kept me company.\nHe was the best. He learned to talk, and he talked very clearly. After a short time, he learned my name and many other phrases.\nHe was so intrigued every time I would talk. I remember the times I would be laying on my bed and would start talking to him. Right when I would start talking, he would look at me, come out of his (open) cage, and jump on my chest. Then he would lightly tug on my bottom lip with his beak - as if to ask me to talk again.\nAfter more time passed, he would literally say, \"I love you, impreprex\". He was the sweetest creature I have \n met.\nOne day, I had to run outside to get something from my mom's car. I was also talking on the phone. Snowbird flew onto my shoulder as I was about to go outside, so I gently shooed him off. He flew back on and I was so preoccupied with things that I didn't realize it until I was outside. \nThe second I realized he was outside with me, I knee-jerked and tried to grab him, but it was too late. My best friend was already flying off into the distance and that's the last time I ever saw him. I know he was calling my name in his last minutes on this planet.\nFuck, does that still hurt like it happened yesterday. \nI love you, Snowbird and I will NEVER forget you. And here come the tears (I'll live).\nEdit: Thanks for the gold. I do appreciate it and I apologize if I saddened anyone with this post. \nThe one thing I forgot to include was the exact relevance to what the OP was asking:\nHe was the best $20 I've ever spent. I remember that I would always tell my mom, \"It's unbelievable how only $20 could buy so much happiness\".\nIt seems like a dream and sometimes I wonder if it was real. I mean, this dude was like something you'd see in a movie. He was remarkable.  :)"], "type": ["COMMENT"]}

Whereas a normally-functioning brain will only keep what information it deems most relevant, or differing enough from information it already has stored to warrant another entry, basically. This is what would allow someone to notice minor changes in something significantly more effectively than their co-worker.\nThough there's also Phonetics and Mnemonics to consider, which I think can be tested in a Psychometric Personality Test.. or you can read up on them and try to work out if you use these techniques to enhance your memory.

What I finally realized was that the reason I was the filler friend was that I wanted to be liked so badly that I wasn't letting any of my real personality show and was instead just kind of there, nodding in agreement with the group. Take a stand, be more opinionated, talk about your interests. You will have fewer people than before moderately like you, but more than before really genuinely liking you for you. Hope this helps!

The most important thing in my life until graduation was the fact that I had been able to attend my dream school. Pretty shortsighted, but it was something I'd wanted since I was a little kid. When I graduated, I was delivering pizzas for $7.25/hr and tips, while my roommates were getting internships or going to grad school. I had no idea what I wanted...I have a slightly better idea now, but nothing concrete, really. At least I'm in a stable office job now. Between graduation and now has been kind of a personal journey, learning about myself - what I really enjoy, how I motivate myself, etc.\nI feel like the time spent reflecting on that kind of stuff right after graduation set me up well for the next stage in life, which is more about trying to find a way to make money doing things that I enjoy. I don't know what that is, but I can be more honest with myself and more focused in that search. I know I wasn't ready to do this when I left school, that's for sure.  "], "type": ["COMMENT"]}

I don't think she can do anything without seeking out the approval from her mom and it seems like her only ambition in life is to meet her mom's expectations of who she should be. Her mother seems to take full advantage of it and her dad just enables it.  When dad's out on a business trip she doesn't go out at all because \"mom will feel lonely or get scared\".  If she wants to buy anything, whether in actuality or not, it feels like she goes through mom for approval.\nI'm pretty sure that if I stay with this girl she's going to want us to live with mom and dad the second we get hitched, and mom will then just have dictatorship over EVERYTHING -- our finances, our life goals, our vacations, how we spend our leisure time, when we have kids, how they're raised, etc. I'm an independent person and I want a partner with whom I can blaze my own trail and carve my own path in the world, and I don't think I would ever be able to do that with her mom trying to pull strings.  \nAnd yet, here I am making vacation plans and thinking about the future, hoping and praying that it won't be so bad but I think I know that it will.  She's 25 and has yet to stand up for herself, opting instead to avoid conflict by just doing whatever her mom wants.  No matter how much she says it will change I really don't trust it, because when it comes down to it she won't know how to stand up for her own independence and will try to please everyone OR err on the side of mom over us, pleading \"it's not my fault\" or \"well she's my mom what can I do\".\nOtherwise it's great. We love all of the same things.  She's totally reasonable in terms of balancing our activities and shared interests, splitting mutual time together with our own independence. She is loyal to a fault, we have a blast together, and can enjoy each other's company endlessly. We share some of the same views independently with regards to how we would raise kids and what lifestyle we would live (minus her wanting to live with her parents so she can see them every day).

To give some perspective, I'm a high school senior right now, and all 6 of my classes are AP classes which results in me receiving several hours of homework every night, Monday through Friday. I do take Fridays off however and offload that work onto Saturday and Sunday, otherwise my brain would have already imploded. Tonight I expect about 2-2.5 hours to finish my calculus, German, and physics homework with another 2-3 on fixing a collaborative English essay. Somehow I still manage to get half decent grades though. All As and Bs so far but English is continuing to be a bitch and physics and calculus are becoming a bitch. On top of this schoolwork I'm juggling college applications, scholarship applications (but I did score in the 98th percentile on the ACT so I hope scholarships take off a significant portion of my tuition. I also already have 29 credits at the local community college which can transfer to a larger university), and my Eagle project which stresses me out even more. If all this work is supposed to prepare me for college or a real job then I don't want to be part of it.\nI'm depressed and regularly have suicidal thoughts even though I don't plan to act on them. I visited a therapist from February through August and I improved during that time frame, but not because of what the therapist was doing. I simply happened upon some activity that made me happier and a little more sociable, but since that's over I've sunk down to where I was before. Oh, and I hated that counselor because she has a very family-oriented treatment plan which I fucking hated because my mom was always there and I couldn't say anything around or about her that I'm really thinking. I have no idea how I even get out of bed in the morning. It's counterintuitive given how I feel. In some fucked up way I sorta like it. At least I feel something.\nBecause of all this on my shoulders I'm regularly at odds with my parents. My temper is short and results in a lot of friction between us, which, as expected, isn't great. My mom can tell I'm bogged down a bit but my dad is seemingly oblivious that this stress can possibly be causing this. Neither of my parents are aware of the whole depression thing rearing up again though.\nVideo games aren't as fun anymore but it's sure as hell better than real life. I do find respite in music and like to dabble in production a bit. It's fun to be creative and maybe let some of my emotions out. I've never been an artistic person but I only recently discovered my love for music. But because of school I don't have much time to do this.\nI just need a hug :c"], "type": ["COMMENT"]}

It might be helpful. I (F) was married for nearly 5 years, and was always the kind of person who felt like divorce was for quitters or people who didn't take their vows seriously, etc. After a year or so into our marriage, I grew increasingly frustrated with the lack of sexual desire my husband showed me, and found out that he was spending a good deal of time looking at gay pornography - but he dismissed it as \"curiosity\" that he could handle with things like web filters and password protection, etc. We were part of a fairly religious community at the time, which basically treated all 'sexual immorality' (including looking at regular hetero porn) something that should be managed with abstinence, and so I chose to support this plan: help him keep away from it however I could.\nA few years later we moved cities, and what began as a lack of physical intimacy quickly turned into a lack of emotional intimacy. I came to realize (mostly through comparison with close friendships) that we didn't trust each other with secrets, we didn't share ourselves with each other without fear of rejection or ridicule...out of mutual resistance to sharing the 'dark' parts of ourselves (e.g., my doubt in our relationship, his sexual identity) we also started hiding the good parts of ourselves, lest those be rejected too. He became more involved in outside friendships, and so did I. And despite multiple times crying out to him that I felt like something was missing and that I wanted intimacy with him, he insisted that he didn't know what to do differently. \nEventually I realized that whether it was a sexual orientation/identity issue, or perhaps a larger issue of him not wanting to be honest and close with himself, and therefore not being able to be close to me...I couldn't do it anymore. What pushed me over was coming to see that I'd quietly decided not to have children -- even though I really really want to be a mother --  because I was afraid that, like \n below, they would develop a flawed vision of marriage and partnership that would hurt them in longer-lasting psychological ways.  So, I told him I wanted a divorce. The rest was fairly amicable, though he definitely blamed me and felt betrayed/embittered for something he swears he never saw coming. \nNow, it's 2 years later and I'm in a healthy, very passionate (physically and emotionally) relationship with someone I truly consider my best friend. We talk honestly about our fears, our doubts, our ugly parts...even when those things have to do with our relationship. \"Do you feel about me like you always imagined you'd feel when you fell in love for real?\" was a conversation we had in the car this weekend. scary, but rich - and the vulnerability in things like this brings us closer. \nMeanwhile, my ex is now living with his boyfriend who he has been dating since shortly after we separated. \nIn the end, everything worked out - it was painful AS FUCK for a few months there, and I had to really enter into honest communion with myself in the worst of it. For instance, \"Am I a liar if I break the vow I made to be beside him forever?\" was a big question I had to dwell in for a long time. But that pain was worth it. I learned a lot about myself, I recognized a strength in me I didn't see before, and I came to understand and accept him through it - even though that acceptance was manifested in the form of breaking up. \nEven though it all worked out ok - it could have been easier. Here's how: if, in the early days of sharing with him my hurt at feeling shut out...if he'd said, \"look. here's what is happening in my heart - it is breaking at the thought of losing you, but it is also breaking at the thought of continuing to lie to you about who I really am and what I really need to be happy. I need you to help me know how to move forward, because you're my best friend.\" But before he could do that, he had to know himself - which he never committed to doing.\nI met with him recently, and was surprised to find that despite all that's happened, despite coming out as gay to his friends and family, despite going to drag shows every weekend with a completely new set of friends, he maintains that the end of our marriage was my doing, my decision, and probably due to infidelity on my part. Him being gay and us being divorced are unrelated in his mind. I was pretty shocked to find that even with all the changes he's made on the outside, he's still not ready to be honest with himself about who he is, about what we had together, and about what it means to have real intimacy with another person. \nSo, with all that in mind, I would ask you to do nothing right now - don't talk to your wife or kids, don't go on tinder or grinder, don't hide yourself away in stealth mode fantasies that consume you and leave you feeling raw, guilty, and separate. Don't do those things. Instead, start by communing with yourself. Get to know yourself, today - through journaling, through therapy, through meditation. Find intimacy with yourself, forgive yourself, accept yourself, and love yourself. Then, reach out to your partner, and tell her you need her help. She will likely be hurt and angry, and may throw a lot of rejection at you - which is why I say start with yourself. Fix that relationship first, through honesty and self love, so you can be there for yourself when there's no one else turn to in the darkest days. They will be dark, but they will in actuality be very few in comparison to the lightness of self-acceptance. \nChange is painful. But resignation to a life of separation from your true self is death. \nEdit: saw how fucking long this was so added TLDR."], "type": ["COMMENT"]}
