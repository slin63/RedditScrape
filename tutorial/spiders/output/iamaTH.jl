Ohkay Owingeh is Tewa (our native language) for \"Land of the strong people\". Many people do not know this but before Santa Fe was the Capital, Ohkay Owingeh was the first in New Mexico. I am very close with people on my reservation and have been told by some of my friends outside of the reservation in NM and Illinois that I should do one of these to answer any questions that people have for Native Americans.\nHey everyone it is 5:25 PM here in Chicago (Sun, OCT 8th) I am going into work right now but I will try my absolute best to answer as many when I get off tonight. I did not think it would become this big but I am still willing to help out more people that want answers. I'm sorry if I haven't gotten in depth too much, I will change that after tonight. \nAlso, to everyone who is \"from a reservation\" and is getting offended by me on \n/r/nativeamerican\n and on this post for saying the Imagery in sports doesn't bother me, I dont know what to tell you. It is NOT an issue to me nor is it to a general amount of people from my Pueblo. If you think I'm some kind of fraud feel free to call up the Tribal Administration of Ohkay Owingeh and they'll be more than happy to tell you I am a well known member. I DO NOT SPEAK FOR ALL NATIVES, this just my humble opinion. \nAlso, I will not be answering any more questions about \"Skinwalkers\" I've given a story (and as much info as I know) to at least ten other redditors on here.\nASK ME ANYTHING!"], "title": ["I am a Native American, who was raised on a reservation and trying to answer general q's that people have.
