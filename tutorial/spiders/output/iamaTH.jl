Rather, I think I \nwas\n. I'm a bit put off lately. I know, you're up here, up there, Carson's no good, Sanders is done with, I know, I know...but, please answer me this: Why does a guy who doesn't answer to anyone or anything have to plug his ghost-written book and Simon & Schuster so much? Furthermore -- you're so wealthy, so privy, you must be aware the current United States and it's plethora of wars & tensions are, in and of themselves, self-serving propaganda. If you really want to change the \"country\", make it great \"again\" (pre 1933, I hope...), shouldn't you expose the truth as opposed to contributing to the establishment's (sic: shadow governments) grand illusion?\nOr is your campaign a product of US propaganda itself, a very distracting one indeed?\nWhat I mean by propaganda is exactly what you'd think: Pure opportunistic nonsense spoon fed to the masses and regarded as common sense or fact; as they don't know any better -- they've been \"educated\" via the same \"system\" that aims to indoctrinate and control them. What would a government exist for if not to control and keep itself in power? It's obviously not to uphold, create and honour the legal system (which they also created/create) -- US media has the legal system being made fun of many times daily, hourly.... So, it's sort of all a big, ironic joke, huh?\nWhy don't you just buy all the large US media corporations/conglomerates and \"win\" that way? Why not buy congress, buy everyone? Why the publicness? Is it a Charlie Sheen thing? I wouldn't blame you if it were, I also like attention and am a charming individual who can garner the attention of a room in mere seconds. I gets it.\nRespect and good luck to you...just one last question, on a not-so-serious note: that must've been quite an Adderall trip, to run your very-active campaign, 3 or 4 interviews a day, a 24/hr Twitter account, all whilst writing a book....in less than 3 months...Less than 2 if I'm not mistaken...How do you do it, Mr. Trump?

My position was established in 2013 through the support of the Animal Legal Defense Fund (ALDF), the Oregon District Attorney\u2019s Association (ODAA), and the Benton County District Attorney\u2019s Office.\nI have been a prosecutor since I graduated from Lewis & Clark Law School in 2009. I started my career as a Deputy District Attorney in Multnomah County from 2009-2013. In 2012, I was named one of the nation\u2019s Top Ten Animal Defenders for my work on several cases at Multnomah County.\nSince I became AC-DDA in September 2013, I have been appointed as a special prosecutor to handle almost 80 cases in 19 of Oregon\u2019s 36 counties. I prosecuted the first felony animal neglect case that went to trial in Oregon\u2019s history, which resulted in a guilty verdict and a 36 month prison sentence.\nI also train prosecutors, law enforcement, veterinarians, and animal control officers throughout Oregon in how to successfully investigate, charge, and prosecute animal cruelty charges. Additionally, I have used my position to raise the media profile of animal cruelty issues, both in news reports and through my Twitter account, @AnimalDDA.\nHere are some articles about me and my work:\n\u201cThe Animal Lawyer,\u201d\n Willamette Week, December 3, 2014\n\u201cGuilty of Animal Neglect,\u201d\n Polk County Itemizer-Observer, December 17, 2014\n\u201c2 Columbia County residents convicted of animal neglect in abuse of cattle,\u201d\n The Oregonian, October 7, 2014\n\u201cWest Salem man sentenced for cat poisoning,\u201d\n Salem Statesman-Journal, October 12, 2015\nAnd here\u2019s \nmy proof\n.\nDisclaimer:\n Naturally, as a prosecutor, there are some things I cannot talk about. I am pretty constrained in the comments I can make about pending cases, and I cannot give legal advice, but please feel free to ask me (almost!) anything else! Nothing I say should be interpreted as legal advice. All answers are my own; nothing I say necessarily reflects the opinion of ODAA, the Benton County District Attorney\u2019s Office, ALDF, or any of the 19 District Attorneys I have been appointed by."], "title": ["IamA Statewide Animal Cruelty Prosecutor, AMA!"], "type": ["THREAD"]}

We are here to answer questions about our series of \nsix freely available Coursera MOOCs on systems biology and biotechnology\n, which are now being released in a new \"on-demand\" format for flexible consumption. The first, \nIntroduction to Systems Biology\n, has been available for about a month, and the second, \nExperimental Methods in Systems Biology\n, has just come on-line. These courses can be taken alone on-demand, or as a scheduled sequence \"specialization\" for a validated certificate, which we envision helping the careers of people from students to those in various pharmaceutical and biotechnology industry positions. These courses were made possible by a grant from the National Institutes for Health (NIH) for our \nSystems Biology Center New York\n. We're also very happy to answer any questions about the science behind this field of systems biology, including our efforts to make a lot of our data publicly available through our NIH \nLINCS Center DToxS\n, part of a \nconsortium of six centers\n across the USA!\nProof:  \n*\nImgur\nTwitter\n**Edit\nIt's 2pm EST and we're getting back to our scientist lives.
