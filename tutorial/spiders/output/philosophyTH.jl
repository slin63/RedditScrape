{"votes": ["63"], "sub": "philosophy", "author": ["ConclusivePostscript"], "url": ["https://www.reddit.com/r/philosophy/comments/3rahrm/kierkegaard_vs_johannes_de_silentio_on_the/"], "text": ["In his journals and papers, Kierkegaard writes, \u201cAbraham is the eternal prototype of the religious man. Just as he had to leave the land of his fathers for a strange land, so the religious man must willingly leave, that is, forsake a whole generation of his contemporaries even though he remains among them, but isolated, \nalien\n to them. To be an alien, to be in exile, is precisely the characteristic suffering of the religious man\u201d (\nJP\n 4: 4650; 1850). From this point of view, there is an important analogy between Abraham and the life of faith.\nKierkegaard\u2019s pseudonym Johannes de Silentio, though focusing on the \nAkedah\n, briefly refers to this dimension of Abraham as well in his \u201cEulogy on Abraham\u201d: \u201cBy faith Abraham emigrated from the land of his fathers and became an alien in the promised land. \u2026 By faith he was an alien in the promised land \u2026\u201d (\nFear and Trembling\n, p. 17; 1843). There is, on this point, no clear disagreement between Kierkegaard and his pseudonym. (For de Silentio, this theme also looms large in Problema III.)\nHowever, when we turn to the \nAkedah\n\u2014the main focus of de Silentio\u2019s \nFear and Trembling\n\u2014we find sharp disagreement. De Silentio, of course, makes much of the \u201c\nhorror religiosus\n\u201d of the \nAkedah\n (p. 61), and suggests that it is through Abraham\u2019s willing obedience that he witnessed \u201cto his faith\u201d and \u201cto God\u2019s grace\u201d (p. 22). Speaking to \u201cVenerable Father Abraham\u201d he refers to \u201cthe wonder of your act\u201d (p. 23). He links \u201cthe prodigious paradox that is the meaning of his life\u201d with \u201cthe greatness of what Abraham did [in the \nAkedah\n]\u201d (pp. 52-53). But Kierkegaard minimizes this dimension of Abraham\u2019s significance. Here, instead of an analogy between Abraham and the religious sphere, Kierkegaard perceives a considerable \ndisanalogy\n.\nAccording to Kierkegaard, \u201cAbraham draws the knife\u2014then he gets Isaac again; it was not carried out in earnest; the highest earnestness was \u2018the test,\u2019 but then once again it became the enjoyment of this life.\u201d This test is a mere \u201cchild\u2019s category; God tests the believer to see if he will do it and when he sees that he will, the test is over. Actually to die to the world is not carried out in earnest\u2014but eternity is not manifested either. It is different with Christianity.\u201d Christianity, in which one is \u201cmolded and transformed so that one is consoled solely by eternity\u201d is \u201cthe most agonizing of all the sufferings, even more agonizing than \u2018the test\u2019 in the O.T.\u2026\u201d (\nJP\n 2: 2222; 1852).\nFurther: \u201cIn Judaism God intervenes in this life, jumps right in, etc. We are released from this in Christianity; God has pulled back, as it were, and lets us men play it up as much as we want to. What a mitigation! Well, think again, for it is rigorousness on his part to deny you the childish supervision and to assign only eternity for judgment. When, accommodating himself to the child, he intervened in the world of time, you were perhaps able to turn back quickly from the wrong way if you were on it. Now, however, your whole life is all up to you\u2014and then judgment comes in eternity\u201d (ibid.). \u201cIn the Christian view Isaac actually is sacrificed\u2014but then eternity. In Judaism it is only a test and Abraham keeps Isaac, but then the whole episode still remains essentially within this life\u201d (\nJP\n 2: 2223; 1853).\nNotice that this is not merely a matter of textual focus, so that the Abraham (Abram) of Genesis 12 is more \u201cprototypical\u201d of faith than the Abraham of Genesis 22. The difference, rather, is one of eschatology. For de Silentio, \u201cAbraham had faith, and had faith \nfor this life\n. In fact, if his faith had been only for a \nlife to come\n, he certainly would have more readily discarded everything in order to rush out of a world to which he did not belong. But Abraham\u2019s faith was not of this sort, \nif there is such a faith at all\n, for actually \nit is not faith but the most remote possibility of faith\n that faintly sees an object on the most distant horizon but is separated from it by a chasmal abyss in which doubt plays its tricks\u201d (\nFear and Trembling\n, p. 20, my emphasis). Here we have one of the greatest confirmations of Kierkegaard\u2019s assertion: \u201cIn \nFear and Trembling\n, I am just as little, precisely just as little, Johannes de Silentio as the knight of faith he depicts\u201d (\u2018A First and Last Explanation\u2019; see \nConcluding Unscientific Postscript\n, p. 626). For Kierkegaard himself \nvehemently\n opposes de Silentio\u2019s notion that faith is \u201cfor this life\u201d \nand not\n for the \u201clife to come.\u201d Certainly he stresses that faith has \nsignificance\n for this life, but the ultimate \nfulfillment and consolation\n of faith\u2014at least for Christian faith\u2014is eschatological: \u201cheaven\u2019s salvation is an eternal weight of blessedness beyond all measure, and [the apostle Paul] was the most miserable of men only when he \u2018hoped only for this life\u2019 (I Corinthians 15:19)\u201d (\u2018The Expectancy of an Eternal Salvation\u2019 in \nEighteen Upbuilding Discourses\n, p. 263).\nBut is Kierkegaard fair in his depiction of Judaism in general and Abraham in particular? Though the O.T. references to a general resurrection are few, Jesus\u2019 own eschatology does appear to be rooted therein (see Dan. 12:2; cf. Jn. 5:28-29). Even more to the point, the New Testament portrays the faith of Abraham and the other O.T. saints as looking heavenward (Heb. 11:13-16) not earthward. It seems, then, that Kierkegaard is wrong to say, \u201cIn Judaism everything is promise for this life,\u201d and to suppose that \u201cJudaism is linked to Christianity in order to make Christianity negatively recognizable\u201d (\nJP\n 2: 2225, 2227; 1854).\nIn short, Kierkegaard rightly underscores eternity\u2019s essential place in the Christian life. But in disagreeing with de Silentio\u2019s thoroughly uneschatological portrayal of faith, he could have done better to \nalso\n reject de Silentio\u2019s use of Abraham in that portrayal. Instead, he throws Abraham (and Judaism) under the bus, stressing primarily discontinuity over analogy in the Judaism\u2013Christianity dialectic. If we, for this reason, reject Kierkegaard\u2019s conception of Judaism as short-sighted, then post-\nAkedah\n Abraham can retain his status for us as religious prototype. Granted, we can more clearly observe Abraham\u2019s faith if we read both his voluntary relocation and his faithfulness in the \nAkedah\n as synecdoches which are broader-reaching representations. But it is simply unnecessary, in doing so, to hold that he and every other O.T. saint failed to have even the slightest glimpse of the eschaton, or to disparage Judaism in claiming that \u201cChristianity is a matter of being a man, Judaism of being a child\u201d (\nJP\n 2: 2222). I can almost hear both Sarah \nand\n Abraham laughing at this one."], "title": ["Kierkegaard vs. Johannes de Silentio on the Significance of Abraham"], "type": ["THREAD"]}

The course is a mix of lecture (narrated podcast) and discussion (held live over Skype one night a week).\nThis spring, we'll be offering an ethics class as part of this program. The course covers both ideas in the history of moral philosophy and the application of these theoretical positions to contemporary philosophical issues. There are no prerequisites and high-achieving students with no background in philosophy are encouraged to participate.\nThe cost to participate is $120 per student. Completing the course successfully will earn you 3 academic credits through the University of New Orleans.\nTo qualify, you must: (1)currently be enrolled in a high school in the United States (and receive approval from your high school to participate--we can help with that) or part of a registered homeschooling program; (2)have a minimum cumulative high school GPA of 2.5 or better; AND (3)Have taken one of the following tests and earned at least the listed minimum score: ACT or PLAN: 18 English and 19 math; SAT: 450 English and 460 math; PSAT: 45 English and 46 math; COMPASS: 74 Writing and 40 Algebra.\nYou can find out more about this program by visiting \nhttp://www.uno.edu/tocqueville-project/high-school-dual-enrollment-program.aspx\n, and more about the UNO Philosophy Department, our courses, and our other programs by visiting \nhttp://phil.uno.edu\n, including our online degree program that is open to everyone (not just high school students).\nIf you would like to apply to participate in the program, please email me at csurpren[at]uno.edu.\nHave questions? Please post here and I'll respond as quickly as I can.\nThanks, as always, to the moderators for allowing us to advertise what I think is a great program to expose high school students to philosophy and allow them to earn college credit at a fraction of the usual cost.\nAlso, some of you have asked why I have posted this every few weeks. This program is small--after our screening, we had only 9 students participate this semester. We want all of the students to self-select in and we know that there are lots of active hs students who are interested in philosophy here. If you know anyone who may be interested, please pass this information along to them.\nKind regards,\nChris Surprenant"], "title": ["For-credit philosophy class *for high school students* through the University of New Orleans - registration is now open."], "type": ["THREAD"]}
