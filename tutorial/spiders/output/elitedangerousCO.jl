Also, when you're buying the collector module, make sure you buy the one with the highest time limit that you can afford.  I think mine lasts 300 seconds or something before it expires.  \nAlso, make sure you don't have a message saying refinery full or resources unallocated or something.  If it does, you have to go into your refinery and either vent the unwanted material, or assign it a slot to be stacked into. "], "type": ["COMMENT"]}

I picked that place because the brown dwarf has a cool purplish glow to it, so the scenery while mining is awesome.  \nSlight warning, though.  I'm not sure about now, but last night that entire system was pretty active.  I was interdicted twice, luckily not while carrying goods, but managed to avoid a lot of pirates creeping around the asteroid belts.  I tried 3 different belts before I settled on the one I mentioned to you, and even there, there were other ships milling about.  I just flew along until no one was on my radar, then dug in.

What am I supposed to do short of just grinding up to a bigger ship so npcs are inconsequential anyways? I'm in a built vulture, I drain health pretty fast and shields even faster. Maneuvering and keeping up is not a problem, but even my shield tank build is overwhelmed by the sheer amount of kinetic weapons covering a ship. I can easily take on anacondas and pythons with fixed or gimballed weapons, and rarely take a scratch, but when I fight turret urchins the chronic damage is just absurd.
