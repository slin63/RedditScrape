When you see other ships on your scanner, target them and see what the scan says. Are they wanted, for example? Are they keeping behind you, such that they might be planning to inderdict? What are they flying, and what's the pilot's combat rank?\nIn any case, decide in advance what you will do if you're interdicted, and then do it right away. So if your decision is that you're going to run (as is often a wise strategy in a Sidewinder), just submit to interdiction, then as soon as you drop out into normal space, boost away and charge your FSD the moment it's cooled down. Don't consider the matter - that just gives your enemy time to land some free shots while you dither.\nIf possible, high wake away rather than just jumping back to supercruise as you can't be mass locked for an interstellar jump."], "type": ["COMMENT"]}

The following is a \n about HOW the P2P networking works in E:D context.\nHere's the thing about E:D, in order to keep it without a subscription fee, and have the \"buy once, play as you like\"-mentality (expansions is another matter, since then you're buying the extra content, not paying to play the game that you bought earlier) they've gone for a P2P networking model. This means that they offload a lot of networking/processing from their own servers to the clients, making the clients running the actual interactive world, and having the server just being authoritative in confirming stuff like transactions, establishing connections for you between instances and such. This greatly reduces the cost of running the servers, as they can manage with fewer, or less powerful servers and don't need as much bandwidth. Although, even since the space-flying and stuff is handled by the clients, the servers still need to keep up with all the clients requesting new instances, swapping ships, docking, trading, buying stuff. Every such request is not a lot, but it all adds up once you get thousands upon thousands of simultaneous users.\nUnless you use a cloud platform, servers are expensive. Like, really expensive. I think E:D would need to see a strain on their servers for a while until they buy another one, because buying a redundant server when what they only were experiencing was a short spike in popularity, the added servers would be a bad investment. Especially to a company that don't rely on subscriptions, but have to make the money they get from people buying the game/expansions to last until they can push out another expansion.\nAll in all, I am as frustrated as anybody, but since I believe this is the case (again, I don't KNOW this is the case, but it's an educated guess), and I understand the reasoning I imagine FDev have.

Missions took no time to accept and the entire visit took about 10 seconds in its entirety. The reason is that the client just assumed that everything would work as intended when accepting the missions, and is in the background waiting for confirmation on the previously sent requests. This is when something goes wrong, not always, but sometimes, missions goes missing. The reason being that one of the mission requests got lost in transit, and you were no longer at the station, so no new requests would be considered 'valid', or even if they were, for how long would you, as a client, be retrying an assumed accepted mission, and for how long should the server accept such requests after you left the station? What happens when someone, inadvertently passes that threshold?\nThe effect would be missions suddenly disappearing from your mission contracts, which would be disastrous from a game design viewpoint.\nA compromise would be the ability to check-box select missions and bulk-send mission requests to the server in one request.

I love it, but it is a bit fragile for conflict zones--those places are deathtraps because you'll often get swarmed by two or three NPCs. I would suggest sticking to RES sites and Nav beacons.\nThat ship is super manueverable, so be sure to stick some good thrusters on there (yes, they are $$). You'll also need a good powerplant and some good shields. The DBS has 4 utility slots, so if you have power left over you can even stick a couple shield boosters to help keep your shields up. For weapons, I use 2 gimballed beam lasers and 2 fixed multicannons. If you're just starting out, it may be worth it to stick with gimballed weapons.\nMalfunctioning components may be because you are getting hit with missiles or heat weapons. When you choose an opponent to attack take a good look at their rank (Harmless/Competent/Deadly etc) and what they are flying. If it's a ship that is much larger than the DBS, don't attack unless they already have the space cops attacking them. If it's an NPC with a higher rank, be very cautious as they will be much harder to kill. During an attack, try to stay behind them. This requires use of all of the thrusters your craft has. You need to get good at strafing up/down/left/right/forward/backward. Also, practice running away if an NPC gets the better of you.\nGood luck!"], "type": ["COMMENT"]}

I didn't immediately fall in love with this game, but Frontier's attention to detail and the abso. fantastic community around this game keeps me interested.\nAnyway, I remember installing and running the original some years ago, but never really getting into it. I don't know, maybe I was too young or too impetuous at the time.\nWell, sometime after the initial release of Elite Dangerous, my buddy had us all play around with it after one of our tabletop meetups. He had some cheap HOTAS setup that was good enough to get a feel for it. I did a couple of the training simulations, nothing too much. I think it was in the Steam sale at the time, so I went ahead and bought a copy while it was cheap but I didn't touch it for about a year. I didn't watch any lets plays. I didn't read anything. I had other shit to do, okay?\nAbout six or seven weeks ago, I just started playing it. I didn't really know what I was doing and just explored the game cosmos and all of the interfaces and really started \n. Prior to the start of the Fall semester, I played for an embarrassing amount of hours for about two weeks. So, I spent a lot of time exploring the game, spoiler free, and discovered a lot of things on my own before even engaging with the metagame community. I figured out fuel scooping by trial and error after stumbling upon one for sale at a station. It blew my fucking mind. I'm hooked.\nSure, now that I'm a few hundred hours deep and have some more defined goals, I look things up using metagame tools and engage with the metagame community, but since my first experience was a pure spoiler free thing...  I got to make the game my own. I recommend, to anyone who is interested in Elite, that you just play it and don't get caught up in the rat race of \"how to make the most internetspacebux in the least hours.\" Don't grind, just fly!"], "type": ["COMMENT"]}

I started at Nav Beacons with basic gear, and now I'm farming money in a high-intensity RES point in Empire space for extra bounties, using a K-warrant Scanner to maximize my profits. If I want to make good bank via combat without getting a significant bounty myself, am I playing optimally? I worry that I'm missing something, because the income is largely determined by enemy spawns which appear to be somewhat random - sometimes I'll get 50k of bounties and a Cobra will breach my canopy, other times I'll rack up 1mil easily with help from the system police and some lucky spawns, and return to collect at 90% hull. Taking missions would probably help but I'm not finding many that would fit well with my general habit of going to a place with some wanted folks and killing them until I need to leave.\nI'm flying a Vulture which has served me well - picked mostly because of its high maneuverability. The problem I'm running into now that I've got the money to outfit it with A-class modules is that I'm running out of power to the point where I'm not sure of an optimal loadout. Hopefully \n works to see the current loadout. The turning rate has been a significant hurdle for me as until this point I was flying a Viper MkIV which was painfully slow to turn around, so I'm enjoying the combat a whole lot more now that I have a more nimble ship. Am I doing something wrong? If I want a good general-purpose ship that's got the same kind of maneuverability as the Vulture, am I out of luck? I'm considering keeping the Vulture as a purely combat-focused ship and buying something like an Asp Explorer as a general-purpose vessel. \nWas it a mistake for me to pledge to the Emperor so soon? I like the powerplay system but being under higher threat of attack in most of the galaxy seems like too great a trade-off for now. \nAside from potentially running into actual players, is there a reason to play in Open Play? I've been playing with a few friends in a private group. If I shift over to Open Play, are there better rewards to counter-balance the risk of a skilled/equipped player destroying me?\nIt seems like the standard combat flight method is to run at half throttle and try to keep the enemy in your sights, switching flight assist + throttle off when you need to do a 180. Is this the most common method? I feel like I might be under-valuing the lateral thrusters, and barely use them in combat. "], "type": ["COMMENT"]}

Look for Threat level 1 sources if you are in a small ship.\nFinally, the best place to find combat is in Conflict Zones. There are two kinds, low threat and high threat. You might want to stick to low threat for now. These zones can be found in the Navigation tab on your left panel, and you enter them as you would any instance. Here you find a battle between two factions, one of which is likely your target. Just make sure to scan a ship and find a target before shooting it! Once you attack a ship from a faction, all other ships in the faction will also consider you fair game (but might be busy fighting another NPC). If you google \"Conflict Zones Elite Dangerous\" there is a good forum post going into further detail about these zones.\nIf you hit a ship that is not a mission target, you might temporarily aggro them and get a bounty. The aggro can be lost by jumping into supercruise, but the bounty must be paid for in any station in the system where the offence it occurred (usually)."], "type": ["COMMENT"]}
