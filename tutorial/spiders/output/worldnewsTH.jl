Treating every stabbing incident as major world news has the drawback of the topic dominating the front page, drowning out other stories and spreading out discussion across several threads. Trying to select major incidents over minor ones is bound to lead to inconsistent decisions with such rapidly developing stories. Hence we believe a collective thread for all violent incidents is the best approach.  Users are encouraged to submit posts conveying recent developments in the comments section of this sticky thread.  Moderators will periodically review the comments and update this post with recent events.  \nTop level comments must be links to news.\n  All other submissions about these incidents will be removed.  \nAs a reminder, please be mindful of the \nsubreddit rules\n when posting.  We'd like to remind you that calling other users shills, apologists, racists, islamophobes or antisemites are all considered personal attacks and thus against the rules.  Please discuss the issues and the comments made, not the persons making them.  If you find comments which violate our rules, you\u2019re encouraged to use the report button or alert the mods via modmail so that we can investigate.\nThank you,\nThe World News Team.  \nResources\nPrevious Thread\n | \nFirst Thread\n \nIDF Live Blog\n | \nIDF Twitter\n ||| \nPMG Daily Reports\n | \nMa'an News Twitter\nRecent Events\n10/26/15 Events\nTerror attack against IDF soldiers thwarted in Hebron\nRocket from Gaza explodes in Israel near border\nIsrael Air Force strikes Gaza targets following rocket attack on South\nIDF soldier seriously wounded in stabbing attack near Kiryat Arba\nPDF Warning:\n \nPalestinian Monitoring Group Daily Report\n (discussion comment \nhere\n)\n10/27/15 Events\nAttack by 2 Palestinian teens foiled in Jerusalem, police say\n (discussion comment \nhere\n)\nPalestinians stab IDF soldier at Gush Etzion junction\n (discussion comment \nhere\n)\nBy the numbers: 1,703 terror attacks since the start of 2015\nPDF Warning:\n \nPalestinian Monitoring Group Daily Report\n (discussion comment \nhere\n)\n10/28/15 Events\nTimes of Israel 10/28/15 Liveblog\nTwo attempted stabbing attacks in West Bank, one Israeli hurt\n (discussion comment \nhere\n)\nArab-Israelis arrested for hurling firebombs on Highway 6"], "title": ["Wave of Violence in Israel and the Palestinian Territories"], "type": ["THREAD"]}
