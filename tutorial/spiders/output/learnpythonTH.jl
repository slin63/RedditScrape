If you follow \nr/learnprogramming\n you might have seen \nthis post yesterday\n where \nu/b_n\n listed ten questions he'd been asked when interviewing for jobs as a JavaScript developer. I'm not really interested in programming jobs, but the first line caught my eye:\n\"1. Define a function that returns n lines of Pascal\u2019s Triangle. (this question was the entire interview)\"\nI don't have a strong math background and had no idea what Pascal's Triangle is \n(it's here if you're interested)\n so I read a little about it and thought \"whoa, that's way out of my league.\" But I couldn't stop thinking about it and finally I just decided to try. So, after diving into this and totally ignoring my other responsibilities I think I've created a code that works. \nI realize a lot of people could probably have whipped this thing up in like, half an hour, but I wont lie; it took me a long, long time over the past day and it was pretty difficult for me. However, I learned a lot, particularly regarding how to use functions, while statements and how to increment numbers. I'm posting my pastebin link in the hopes that some of you more savvy Python programmers might show me some easier ways to accomplish the same things (and inevitably point out whatever bugs I've missed. One off the bat: my introduction input is printing 'none' for some reason, and I can't make it stop but at this point I need to go be a grown up and take care of some chores).\nI can't help but feel a little like a plagiarist because when I couldn't make a particular function work (looking at you, range(x,y,z)) I would Google how to manipulate the function correctly and usually came away mimicking someone else's code more than I'm comfortable with. I'm not sure yet what level of plagiarism is just part of programming or is unacceptable.
