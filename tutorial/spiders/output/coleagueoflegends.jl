Lol no. Aatrox was a strong jungler on release because he had a ton of sustain with a Doran's Blade start and you could just tower dive and get away with it because of the passive. That was it, he was never broken. He can still do those things but the meta doesn't cater to him at all. Solo laners bring teleport which makes the tower diving threat less effective, and sustain isn't important at all in the jungle because you have the top laner soaking all damage from two camps when double jungling (which everyone at high elo does pretty much) and then you can rely on Trailblazer for sustain. His top laning was never his strong suit anyway, so he's just outclassed as a jungler due to power creep."], "type": ["COMMENT"]}

Its said of Japan as well, and its true they are very loyal towards their employers, and often are under great pressures to perform. But these countries also suffer from apathetic groups, like the NEETs, and the hikikomori of Japan.\nI think the concept is mostly a result of stereotype. The only stat that suggests its true would be hours worked, where Korea is 2nd, vs the US at 12. But Mexico is 1st and Greece 3rd, and these countries arent accoladed for their work ethics (not saying they dont have strong work ethics, just perception. )\nA better measure would be worker efficiency/productivity, and here we see the U.S. and European nations shine, while the east Asian countries lag behind. That is to say, the US and European workers produce a very high amount per hour worked, while Japan, Korea, and other East Asians produce relatively little.\nFurther, the concept of work ethic is not really something that can be measured or compared, and its fairly subjective. While Americans and Germans might find getting straight to business to be good work ethic, a Briton or Frenchmen would likely find this to be a bit stale, and would find a bit more personability to be appropriate. Likewise, some things done in Eastern work forces might be in poor taste to the west, and vice versa.\nDidnt mean to rant, but I see this idea passed around a lot when it comes to Korean e-sports dominance, but there doesnt seem to be anything but anecdotes and stereotypes perpetuating this idea, and the concept of work ethic is not really something that can be measured or compared between two regions with such vastly different cultures.

I highly recommend you look up the working conditions of the South Korean entertainment industry (especially movie and television actors). Reading the controversies surrounding people who speak out against the honestly horrifying conditions they are expected to work under might help illuminate where part of the stereotype of Eastern work ethic comes from. Looking up the expected schooling regimen of the average South Korean grade-schooler will also reveal a gigantic difference in expected work-load than we face in the West.\nIt has also been incredibly obvious to anyone that has been into e-sports since SC1, that Korean pros practice better and for longer hours than Western pros. Work ethic is, indeed, very hard to quantify, but you can't look at the sheer difference in hours and truthfully say that there's only anecdotes and stereotyping.\nIt's also no secret that the Korean server is more competitive in general, and there are many different factors for it. A large factor in that is the fact that more boys play the game, so it's a little bit cooler to be good at the game than it is in the West, where more people are likely to think being good at the game simply makes you a nerd. Other factors such as how PC Bangs are set up for payment, and the fact that the e-sports industry is larger and more advertised in South Korea (and thus more kids desire to go pro), are big contributors to the boost in competitiveness we see over there."], "type": ["COMMENT"]}

I really agree with this one. One of the most ridiculous reason why the server is polluted with toxicity is because, the amount of Asians who barely knows how to speak english playing this game. Not being racist or anything but its extremely annoying because these players only know how to call their role, and verbally abuse people (saying words like SB, or randomly speaking chinese) when they dont play up to their standards. Another fact that makes it work is that they refuse to communicate with the team and when they find somebody in the team who speaks the same language they would only communicate to them. I find this really ridiculous because there shouldnt be any problem playing and interacting with different players from around the globe, but if the majority of players that are not from the OCE server are like this, i find it really overwhelming "], "type": ["COMMENT"]}

Frozen tomb is so telegraphed a smart Fiora can easily Riposte it and stun you instead. The same applies to Ring of Frost, nullifying 1/2 of your abilities.\n2.) Lissandra doesn't have an ideal build path against Fiora. She wants to build Morellos into Boots of Lucidity for 40% CDR, mana regen, and the ability to wave clear, but that build makes her too squishy to survive Fiora's burst and a gap closer that is on a ~8 second cooldown.\nRod of Ages takes too long to scale, offers no CDR, and is countered by Fiora's % maximum health true damage.\nZhonya's is core on Lissandra but the armor doesn't protect against true damage.\nSo you get forced into an ineffective defensive build path like Lucidity boots, ROA, Zhonya's just to survive.\n3.) Lissandra used to be a burst mage/utility mage/lane bully. But with the nerfs to her Q and W damage and removal of Deathfire Grasp she has lost her burst identity and struggles to kill anyone by herself. The best you can hope for is to chunk your opponent out of lane and get ahead that way. Unfortunately with TP being on such a low cooldown lane bullies are less effective. Enemies can easily just go back to base, shop, and TP back to lane without losing much CS or experience.\n4.) Lissandra is strong when assassins are strong and assassins are strong when there is one priority squishy target on the other team and that isn't the case in this meta. You can kill the ADC but most teams are 3 threat comps now.\n5.) The health regen on Frozen Tomb was a nice buff and encourages Lissandras to dive in to the enemy team to self-cast but without strong follow-up you're going to die instantly.\nI absolutely love Lissandra and I'll keep playing her but she is definitely a risky pick at the moment."], "type": ["COMMENT"]}

That also helps the \"Bundesliga\" Teams. England for example, is horrible at developing talent, but they are amazing at building structures for the \"Premier League\" .. Since it is more a club than national team in LoL, the PL might be a better example.\nIf you want the West to win now: Remove the \"region lock\", through money at Korean coaches, get Korean players in the West, and the West might win 2016.\nThere is just no way EU or NA wins in the next years, with a majority of EU/NA players and (more importantly) no world class coaches. EU/NA can win, in 10 years, if you but the effort in. But I don't see that. LoL right now is like the England talent development.

Part of why I love League is that so many teams started as 5 guys that put together a team and it led to starting an organization. I mean C9, Team 8, UOL, etc all were small orgs that couldn't exist if it were not for this money. \nI get why they want to get rid of it. It makes sense to get rid of it, but at the same time it gives a way of entry into esports for player owned and started teams that would not have any other way to do so."], "type": ["COMMENT"]}

Riot TR destoryed the whole \"high elo system\" not banning the few scripters (it was so bad that people after games said they can send scripts/drophacks if u pay them and they still didnt get banned) I'm sure RIOT NA/EU is aware of all im writing here and they don't want this to happen again for sure.

She does have outplay potential and high mobility, but mobility is not the main thing this season more than reliable utility. Lulu/Orianna can provide AOE Knockups/Slows/etc. Viktor, Azir, and Orianna provide zoning tools to prevent engages. Basically, Ahri just does not provide effective tools to help her team, like everyone else does. \nAs you saw in the SKT Vs AHQ, despite Westdoor being fed, he was unable to push his lead due to Fizz unable to provide good tools to push his team foward. \nHope this helps you understand!

The true problem begins in midgame, when other mages have their powerspikes with their first and second item (Morello, Luden's/Deathcap).\nBrand would love to build Liandrylai like Rumble, but he also needs mana. And if you get Morello into Rylai into Liandry, that's three items, and the midgame is over, and the enemy team will get enormous value out of any MR purchased (especially Aegis or Hexdrinker). The game might as well be over before you get to build your Void Staff - and that also means you never get to build Deathcap, unless it's your last item (and that's only if you can afford getting away without Zhonya's).\nBrand's gimmick is getting ahead in skirmishes and assembling Liandrylai, preferrably without Morello, just running on two Doran's Rings and a blue buff. And that is simply unreliable strategy, just like his ult. Yeah, if he gets to assemble those items, he's very likely to win, even if he gets focused - just launch your combo, say \"allahu akbrand\" and your team will clean up the slowed, half-hp enemies. But getting there is not something to be certain of, and past the 3-4 item threshhold his winrate actually drops (below 50% as the game goes past 40 minutes).\nI'd say he would see way more play if Liandry's or Rylai's gave mana regen (replace some AP with a Forbidden Idol and you've got it). Right now, Brand support works because he's all about the Rylai's anyway, so giving up other mage items doesn't hurt him that much. It's similar as it is with Zyra or Karma."], "type": ["COMMENT"]}

Brand can be a support as he has abilities that combo together to stun the enemy, holding them in place so other members of your team can deal damage to them.\nBotlane - The lane where the support and attack damage carry are played.\nMord(ekaiser) - A strong attack damage carry who completely changes how the game is played due to his unique strengths and playstyle. As a character he is a massive departure from the widely accepted meta for the length of the games professional play and because of this, he's maintains an extremely high percentage of games in the world championships where he is picked by one team, or banned from play by one team.\nTanky - High health, high defensive stats, difficult to kill. Brand is good against tanks as his abilities (and the items that work best with the character) deal damage in terms of percentages of your opponents health, rather than flat damage, which is difficult for tanks to deal with.\nRengar - \n this character.

If you look at the LCS rules, it currently lists that players/coaches are to be compensated in part if they do not play a full split (or are suspended temporarily like Scarra was). I think it might be necessary to change this slightly, in that they're paid on a weekly basis, rather than per-game, such that you can actually pay subs who might not play at all, but are still official team subs and practicing with the team (Think like Huhi with CLG, not like NB3 when he was TSM's jungle sub for like a month). \nThis would allow players/coaches to be self-sufficient in the event that it was just a group of 5 talented challengers who made a team and qualified for the challenger series, and allow them to negotiate with (and potentially even walk away from) sponsors without feeling like they absolutely must bend to the almighty will of the one with the wallet. A good organization will pay their players fairly, so having the backup will protect players from the bad ones, rather than forcing them to obtain sponsors for a place to live etc... and worry about not being dispensed the pay which they earn."], "type": ["COMMENT"]}

Zilean's slow is better, true, but then we have Tahm Kench's supreme tankyness which fits better into a bruiser heavy meta, and his ultimate, which is unmatched by Zilean. Zilean's passive also punishes roaming in a certain sense as it isn't global anymore and only useful when he is paired with another champ, lowering its efficiency."], "type": ["COMMENT"]}

You are just not ready for ranked to be honest, if you have lost 16 in a row. You need to be able to play at least three lanes, but actually you should be able to play all 5 roles to a decent standard. You should have champions prepared for every role, two picks at least, maybe three. You need to be able to farm on those champions. You need to know the different roles a champion fulfills and what your job is in lane and in fights. If you want to get better at LoL start playing ARAM to get to know more champions and to get better at positioning and team fighting. Get easy picks for every role and practice them. You save time by preparing flex picks like Annie and Lulu that can be played in different lanes. Stick with champions that are easy to play and do not demand much mechanics. For example a Leona or Braum support in Bronze stomps because they are easy and tanky, but Thresh usually has a win rate of under 35%. If you play mechanical demanding champions you have less time to focus on map awareness and positioning or farming. Start with easy champs and get to harder champs once you feel good about the overall game. Further support is especially in low Elo a hard role to carry on and you might have more success when you play a different role. The hard truth is, that you can actually farm yourself out of Bronze without doing much. When I was in Bronze I started to practice farming against bots in custom games. I would practice for hours. I would look at game play by streamers and on youtube and watch closely how they prepare the wave and how they actually farm. I tried to copy it in customs and then bring that champ into normals. After another 15-20 games I feel comfortable to play ranked with them. Then use your farm mechanics and avoid stupid fights in the jungle for no objectives. You know how they always fight at random times in the jungle for no reason at all? That is when I was farming in lane and slowly pressure tower. Then at the 30 minute mark where I have at least a complete item more than my enemy I will join fights around towers or dragons (for some reason baron is ignored at that Elo) kill one or two people with my gold advantage and win the game there. Just know how to farm and not feed while doing it. Then join fights and outdamage them. "], "type": ["COMMENT"]}

Your item builds are okay, your farm should be okay for that elo too, but damn that is the worst KDA I've ever seen.\nIf you want to play defensively you need much better decision making, you need to know where you are safe and where you are not. When you can push and when you need to back off. Need to know how you can create yourself or others a safe space through warding. If you do that correctly you shouldn't die more than 2-3 times in a game.\nIf you want to play aggressively you need to learn to outplay your opponent. Even if you are behind 0/4 you should still be able to get the one or another kill. If you know you are going to die, then don't die like a bitch, at least try to take this one player with you.\nI would advise you to spam a burst heavy mid-laner like Talon or Annie in normal games. Once you hit level 6 forget your lane and go roam, get your gold from kills. Don't be afraid to go nuts. You will learn to estaminate your damage output and be able to get at least some kills out of even the worst situations. This intuition can then be transferred to other positions and is so so crucial in this game.\n Actually, try to play as many ARAM games as possible, you need to learn how to team fight and trade properly, which ARAM is all about."], "type": ["COMMENT"]}

Meanwhile in league we can practically guess who will win it all and what their record will be for the entire tournament.  If we are using a Olympic style sports as a comparison then Basketball, Softball, and Speed skating are more accurate comparisons where countries are so utterly dominate that its predictable who will win from the get go. And even then only Softball has had any recent examples of the level of dominance that the Koreans have had in LoL and SC and the Japanese won in Bejing.\nNow it doesn't mean you are wrong in that we don't need to smash everything and rebuild anew.  The EU teams have taken a good step forward this year but it feels hollow as Korea is weaker than ever and they still produce teams like SKT.

Nautilus has a shield and has the potential to not suffer any HP damage when trading, but Leona has an armor increase that still makes her suffer HP damage regardless. Nautilus has a spammable root in his passive, while Leona has a semi-long cooldown in her Q.

China thought that buying the best players will make them better which is a marketing point of view, and NA is stuck making money through streams and highlight videos (memes too). Each region having their own point of view of the game and each having different outcomes. Now I'm not saying to just go and copy the Koreans but I just think that each region should just find a system that works for them and roll with it. If you want to win worlds then work for it, if you want to just get by and get stream money and sponsors that's ok too.

That makes this an important learning opportunity to figure out how to structure the event, what features to include, and what could be improved. (2) This is the first time the extralife team has created a head-to-head page for communities to compete directly with one another, opening the door for fun rivalries for charity drives in the coming years.

Buying an additional 100 armor means the multiplier is (100/800) and it takes 80 total hits to kill the champ. If you bought 380 health instead (which would be much cheaper) you're still taking 14.3 damage each hit but it now takes 110 hits before you're dead. "], "type": ["COMMENT"]}

The article speculates on a bunch of stuff and I\u2019ll tackle the big ones below. \n1) Franchised LCS Teams / Buy-Outs:\nWhile we think franchising teams might be cool, we're still far off from it even being an option to franchise, so it's impossible to get into the specifics of what a transition would look like. To be frank, we don't know when (or even if) we'll franchise teams. All we\u2019re sure of now is that it definitely won\u2019t be possible in 2016. We\u2019ll share more in the off-season on where we see the LCS and LoL Esports headed, but there\u2019s a lot more thought and research that we need to do before we can talk franchises.*\n2) LCS Subsidies:\nSalary subsidies for LCS teams aren't going anywhere soon. We implemented them when we launched the LCS because we strongly believe in a salary floor for pro players and that hasn\u2019t changed. We also knew not all the original teams could afford to hit that bar at the time. We built the LCS model so that organizations could play in a structured league and use that stability to attract sponsors, grow their fanbase, and ultimately become profitable. Our hope is that as teams are able to increase revenues, they\u2019ll funnel that money back into player salaries, but we aren\u2019t going to remove stipends \u201cASAP\u201d and hope everything just works out.\nWhat's great is that more and more organizations are much stronger now due to LCS and the broader growth of esports, so we're heading in the right direction. If we get to the point where LCS teams can afford to cover salaries without collapsing, we'll consider shifting that subsidy money elsewhere to improve the LCS, but not at the expense of lowering minimum player compensation - if anything, minimum player salaries will likely increase in the future.\n3) Challenger:\nAs we always have, we are looking to improve Challenger. It's a hell of a lot better than it was when we launched it, but there is still more to do. The main goal we have now is to professionalize the scene. New challenger players are signing contracts and playing in a team environment for the first time, and figuring out how to protect them and improve their overall experience is a big priority for us. We have considered adding a player salary subsidy to challenger, but that's not something we've decided one way or the other. We have also considered adding more required protections for players based on things that have worked in LCS (required player contracts, legally incorporated teams, etc), and will finalize all of these plans in the off-season. Lastly, there was a claim that we might require LCS orgs to own challenger teams and that's not something we\u2019re considering.\n*Edit - to be clear, we aren't adding (nor have ever considered) a \"buy-out\" mechanism to the LCS as it exists today. Buy-outs are part of a transition to the franchise system, which as I've said above, is still a ways off from being a possibility."], "type": ["COMMENT"]}

It's so bloody frustrating that the ONLY way to play draft mode as a guy who really only plays with randos is to play ranked. I want to relax and practice draft pick, countering picks and forming progressive comps, without the stress of ranked and the trolls, ragers, and weird foreigners it brings. I know Riot seems to have something against practicing, but that's beside the point. Most of the time, the OCE server \n has access to Ranked solo/duo/teams, Norms blind, and ARAM. That. Is. It. I hate ARAM, it's a bunch of RNG and swift wins or drawn out losses. Norms blind is toxic as fuck; get that bug where you're locked out of chat for 30s at the beginning of lobby? I hope you like bot lane! Or even worse, people disputing over roles, instalockers who dont get precedent on a role but lock anyway. Ranked is a high-stress environment, and I usually default to blind pick, as unfun as it is, to avoid Ranked. \nGetting One For All was suck a blessing: finally I had a mode where people weren't serious cunts like in Ranked, weren't intentionally stealing roles/champs from others like in Blind, and (mostly) weren't fucked by the RNG of an ARAM match. But that's gone now.\nI'd love more than anything to be able to get more diversity in OCE match possibility. For starters, permanent Twisted Treeline. What do you mean, there isn't enough demand for TT? Players dont like it? We can't know till we have it around for a solid block of time! Currently, OCE has TT on a revolving schedule (I think it's Mon, Wed, Fri or something similar, I dont pay attention to the days when I see it). I imagine letting TT stay up (which seems easier to do than constantly taking it down and putting it up) would not only be easy, but create more interest from the community to play on it! Odds are, an OCE player will log in, click PLAY, see the Rift or ARAM, and go. They wont even consider wishing to play a smaller game of Rift with the relaxed nature of ARAM on TT, since it's not there half the time. \nMy final point in this long, sleep-deprived rant is a demand for norms draft. As I mentioned above, draft queue is so very different to blind and ARAM. The ability to practice counterpicks, team comp creation, and comp counters, all the while \n is invaluable, however entirely lost on the OCE server. Here, 'practice' is an \n, and if you want to practice something, you know damn well Ranked is the last place you should be doing it. It is so very difficult to move from one champ or role to another when the only place I have to practice is Ranked, where my opponent will either counter my own champion or be playing their very best champs to stomp me in a role they're more experienced in. Norms is forever more relaxed, with diehard mains of one role often going something different to break the monotony, as, unlike in Ranked, the win isn't the only thing to worry about. \nNB: I didn't even mention Dominion! It's probably my personal favourite gamemode, and yet is completely unsupported on OCE! The only way to play it is to find 9 friends or randoms in lobbies and go from there. "], "type": ["COMMENT"]}

Your second statement can be completely wrong to be honest. You can freeze if you are behind and freeze if you are ahead. If you are significantly ahead you almost always want to push them in, deny cs and pressure tower.

So you can't get teams like Unicorns of Love, Team 8, or Origen (arguable) anymore. Teams will need a big corp to back them before being able to field a team. Then, you also have those same big corps filling up the Challenger Series, meaning that they have the funds to simply aggressively buy-out the better players.\nBut it's not only that, by limiting orgs to only 1 team in the LCS, you also turn those mandatory Challenger teams into cash farms. Your goal isn't to develop the players and yadda yadda... your goal is to spend $300k to get a LCS spot and sell it for $600k (because you have to sell it either way).\nIf the article's content is true, then I feel like Riot is slowly choking themselves out of being an entertaining e-sport."], "type": ["COMMENT"]}

The NBA team owners own the NBA, therefor the NBA commissioner and the team's interests are aligned, unlike the LCS.

They would likely vote to limit the competition and vote off good, competitive teams that can challenge them. Regi has no ownership of Riot, of course he will not be consulted.  If the LCS was owned by team owners, as the NBA and NFL are, I would agree with you.  But its not and it makes NO sense for Riot to give them this sort of power.  \nThe NBA and NFL aren't outside, separate entities, they are a conglomeration of the team owners, which is a 100% completely different business structure than the LCS.  The NBA, NFL business structures are better for competition because the commissioner and Team owner's interests are aligned, because the league makes profit together.  In the case of the LCS its just marketing for their video game, and the team owners have no stake in Riot so its a completely different ball-game on the business side of things, and not comparable to any major American sports.

It helped a lot for me to go into custom games and 1v5 the bots, just to get the feel or how the abilities work and interact with movement.\nYou also need to be very aware of where the enemy jungler is at all times. Wolf only marks in the river and the enemy jungle and Kindred is very weak early game. \nThere is a good 10-15 second delay between marking a champ and being able to receive the stack, make sure to time it right.

I do it a lot and I think her major issue is that her skills are all too weak without the ulti. In a teamfight you'll get one skill ulted. That skill is very powerful, but it's one. And it costs you a skill too.\nSo in the end you're playing a character that has three different ulties, making you very versatile, but at the cost of having a full skillset, making you sit on one less skill than everyone else.\nIn a teamfight, it's pretty big that you are the one person that can't bring a full 4 skills into the combat. And while you're versatile, none of the skills can make up for it outside of the fight, like say Rek'Sai who can fight without a fourth skill, and instead gain the complete map advantage.\nKarma is very good at disengaging, unless the enemy is coming in too fast.\nIn my opinion, if the ult didn't have anything to do with the skill's base cooldown, that would make her entirely viable in LCS. (i.e ulting should allow you to use any skill, whether it is already on cooldown or not, and using ulti on a skill should not trigger its cooldown.)"], "type": ["COMMENT"]}

So the advice that you should know how to play every role, while still a good idea for getting better at the game, won't be as critical. You'll want to have a main role and a backup role.\nMy suggestion: If you want to be a support main, learn to play ADC. If you don't like or enjoy it, don't worry about playing it a ton, but play it enough that you understand how the role works. It will make you a much better support. \nAs others have said, jungling is similar to support in that it's more of a mapwide role, and more cerebral than mechanical. \nMostly though, do what you enjoy.

You want something who can  provide strong ganks and 2v2 skirmishes in the early game, while also contributing with utility later on. This is mostly because of toplane snowballing very hard in the current meta due to splitpushing/duelist champions being popular. Pro players know how to abuse the fact that Nocturne loses the 1v1/2v2 against most early-game junglers, and will convert that into a lead (either by ganks or just by the fear of ganks) for their lanes. A lead in your Riven vs Fiora matchup up top is way more important than having the scaling advantage of a Nocturne vs Lee Sin.\nAlso, Nocturne ults are generally more impactful in soloq where warding is less organized and the team isn't collectively tracking the jungler.

Still ended up 60 cs down for the rest of the game because he constantly outtraded me in damage. I go sustain and still get forced out. Even with a huge lead I still got shat on. What do I do?

Both explain their reasoning of ganks, warding and itemization. Watch and closely listen to what they say and always look at their mini map to better understand how they jungle, what they see and where they watch while jungling. Then take your champ and start games against bots. Try to get a feel for the champion, their damage, how they clear, their mana cost. After you understand the basics go into team builder and play 15-20 games with every champion. After every game take a look at your stats and try to find things you could have done better. Next game apply the knowledge. Read some guides to better understand your runes, mastery and item options. Then after you have three solid picks with 20 normals on you should be fine. After you played those 60 games and watched all the videos you will see a significant increase in your game knowledge and in your map awareness. Takes you maybe a week or two and you are fine.

Aside from CS, the jungler role and terms within it are a lot different than in Heroes and it's left me a bit confused.\nI was playing my second vs Beginner AI match the other day when the jungler who was playing Kalista asked who she should leash. I asked what that meant and was told to shut up. Alright. Right after minions spawned she asked me and our support to come help her with camp so I scuttled over and fired a buckshot at them. In HotS helping with camp means help take down the camp, but apparently this is not the case in League as she proceeded to rage out on me for a considerable amount of time after.\nI would have just asked her what she meant, but she didn't seem reasonable... or emotionally stable.. so I just stuck to my lane with my Blitzcrank support doing CS and ignoring her random jabs at me throughout the game.\nThrough this I kept watching the minimap for enemy champion awareness and I would notice our mid and top would go into the jungle to meet her, and then almost immediately turn back around and run back to lane. I wasn't sure if I was supposed to run in and run out when she was taking a camp near me, but given her reaction to my being alive I decided to just stay with Blitz.\nSo, Reddit.. what is \"leashing\" for a jungler. Do I need to volunteer for it as someone who wants to first learn ADC main? And I'm sure the top and mid weaving in and out of jungle had a purpose. Is that something I need to be aware of as well?\nAlso, thank you to the Blitzcrank who was laning with me.

Some junglers use it to start fighting a camp, while others (usually the better ones) use it to finish the camp. So if you're helping with the first camp of the game and the jungler hasn't used smite on it yet, it's best to back off when it has just over 400 hp, so you don't steal xp from it.\nJust one of those minor technical things.

The other large reason is because Teleport is a garbage spell on him, and not taking Teleport in a 5's setting is pretty bad, especially for top lane.\nHe's still worth running for teams that want to put in the effort, but there aren't many good Vladimir players on professional teams, and he takes a lot of games to make him work well (because of his really short range)."], "type": ["COMMENT"]}

If vlad is dumb he walks up and you kill him, if not he falls behind in CS and can get snowballed on that way.

I don't know why people are still building it on her. Warrior is in every way better for her. She is a ranged jungler and Devourer got hard nerfed for ranged junglers. Her passive wants her to gank early and get those stacks in early. This means Devourer wants you to power farm while your passive wants you to gank. Does not make sense, right? The warrior item gives you also way more power early and that is where you are most likely trying to get your first two stacks from the jungle camps. If you go for them you have a high chance meeting the enemy jungler and warrior has a better build path than the daggers for that. Further the Warrior is still good and you can snowball more than with the Devourer. I play tested both and after a couple of games you can see it yourself how warrior is better.
