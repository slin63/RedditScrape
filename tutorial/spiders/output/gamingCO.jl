Warzone in the MP is also epic, with many matches concluding with multiple scorpions and other \n vehicles firing at the last 150 point bosses.\nCampaign wise there is a new layer when it comes to the style of missions, you have certain missions being focused completely on learning about the story and what is about to happen, during these missions there are no enemies but instead you get to traverse different bases depending on mission filled with friendly AI, some can be spoken to and some can not, but generally most of them speak to each other and fill a purpose. I love listening to a grunt walking back and forth between to elites, conveying information about how certain battles have gone and such, really helps with setting the mood of the battles on Sanghelios.\nAnd for the lore junkies I think this game is also great, as one myself I was drooling over finally having a good look on Sanghelios, seeing new stuff like Guardians, The Warden, new colonies with real alive speaking citizens and even a new forerunner area or two.\nStoryline throughout the campaign was also very acceptable, there was a clear red line that it followed and the player was easily and clearly notified of what his/hers mission was and why. The story had a massive twist which was slightly hinted at during the middle of the campaign. The soundtrack throughout was incredible with a very classic Halo feeling coming every now and then. The game has more than 120 collectibles as well, with 117 of them supposedly conveying information on certain missions.\nWith the ending and general campaign however, it feels as if Halo 5: Guardians is only a snippet of what 343i has been working on, story wise that is. Halo 4's story finished what we saw in Halo 3, while Halo 5 instead built a ground for future Halo games to stand upon."], "type": ["COMMENT"]}

There's nice bits of dialog, and lore exploring and world building, however, I still wouldn't say it's as great of a narrative as Halo 4 - and that one had OUTSTANDING characters arcs and great explorations on the themes of what it means to be human. \nHalo 5's plot so far (haven't finished it yet, but I'm 3 missions to the end) is good, but it still hasn't beaten the gold standard yet. Fireteam Osiris has some well-rounded characters (the stand-out being Buck). Unfortunately, Blue Team is just \"stoic bad-ass soldiers backing up the Chief\" without much variation outside of gender; I mean, that's how they're written in the books (since individuality was mostly ironed out of their being when growing up), but it's a touch bit harder to sympathize with them.\nThe plot is something that I've never really experienced before. A good number of reviewers complain that sections of the story make no sense and that there are plot holes; that's not really the case. The story has all it's bases covered, but the problem is that the story is segmented and arranged in such a strange manner that unless you're paying attention the \"structure\" of the story (and yes, it's really confusing analyzing it) and implications of characters and lines, it's going to seem like the story is missing elements when in reality it's just hidden beneath the odd choices for narrative composition.

Your character is undead, but you can use an item called 'Humanity' to un-zombify your character, making you look normal. This also allows you to use the online features. This works by invading the world of another player which brings you seamlessly into their game so you can kill them, or summoning, which is designed for co-op.  \nThere's an item you can purchase called an Indictment which, after being invaded and killed, allows you to Indite the player, marking them as a sinner and allowing them to be invaded more frequently by a PVP group designed for killing players with sin. \nSince you have to be human to invade people, this also leaves you open to being invaded yourself. The idea is that being an asshole will make you have a harder time playing due to the constant invasions. It doesn't really work anymore, unfortunately, since there aren't very many players so the number of people in that PVP group is pretty small."], "type": ["COMMENT"]}

The problem is that the game is designed to have a competent team with 4 people. That's just how many enemies there are and what they have to shoot at you. It's expected for you to be surprised by something and drop, but having a bunch of people who can pick you up is nice. They become a liability when you waste resources, or yourself, trying to pick them up. Or thinking they'll do what you tell them to, and having them not do it. Hypothetically you could complete the game without ever picking one of them up, but every time you went down you'd have a much better chance of staying down.\nOh, and if you think it's not that hard to keep them up because you can tell the teammmates to pick them up, unfortunately it doesn't work very well. Usually what drops one will drop the other two, so you have to put yourself in their danger and eliminate the threat or run the odds of being dropped and being less likely to get up."], "type": ["COMMENT"]}

The shotgun is there for oh shit where'd you come from moments (IMO).\nYou can find an incineration cannon with every major boss fight- they don't have to hit the weak spot to be effective. \nApparently you get an achievement for going through the scorpion mission on legendary and keeping the scorpion- accidentally found that out.\nDon't trust your AIs to do anything- they'll probably fuck up. \nWhen the back plate is off, you can take out a hunter with 2 sword strikes.\nYou can't splatter a knight, but they can insta kill you with the incineration cannon.\nDying in a vehicle is permanent- get out before it's too late.\nOn the mission where you run down a guardian, Locke says to run and shoot- don't do that. Move quickly, but slow down/ take cover occasionally to clear enemies. You can't just run down it on legendary.\nOne shot headshots with the binary on most beings if you keep the beam on their head- it lasts like a full second, just glancing the head won't cut it.\nDon't pass an opportunity to stick something because you want to save grenades- there are plenty, and you might die for your prudence.\nI'll probably think of more but that's a good start.

Building a pc isn't like building your own car, its more like putting together a piece of ikea furniture or adult legos (some lego sets may be more complicated than any pc you build). In addition to the better price range, building your own PC allows you to upgrade individual components when they become outdated, or simply expand on what you already have. So here are those links to check out:\n This site will give you a few builds as a meter stick to judge whatever you put together. Alternately, you can just take one of these builds and put it together for yourself, without customizing it\n This article from the people at \n describes what each component does so you can better understand what you're looking for.\n What i imagine you will get out of this link is a few links to guides on how to put the components together, but there are certainly other useful links there, and some basic info.\n Check out this website when you get ready to start choosing your components. They help make sure that the components you choose are compatible with each other, so you don't have to know everything about the components (although you should probably do your own research to make sure these guys didn't miss anything)\n: As the name suggests, this sub lists new sales, which can be filtered for component type. \n So once you build your PC, you're going to need to install useful programs. If you like using free things, check out this link. You click on the programs you want and then download them at the same time. \nIf you have any questions while you're building, I'd be glad to help. I'm far from being an expert, but i've built three different PCs for my family in the last half decade, so at least have some of the answers. The community at \n is pretty helpful, although I do expect them to upsell you. \nGood luck with whatever you choose. If you decide to just buy one, I can't help too much, so look elsewhere for that info."], "type": ["COMMENT"]}

Endorse who you would like, as I will.\nThat said, the value per dollar spent on building a PC outweighs the value per dollar when buying a factory-built PC. If you can't afford it all at once, consider buying a part or two every month or two months. Your most expensive part will probably cost you $300, or $37.50 per week, over 2 months.

I'm not saying PCs are cheap, but I am saying that they are affordable with proper budgeting, assuming you are in a position to buy any of the alternatives to a gaming PC in the first place. \nIs a PC as cheap as a console? Nope. If all you want to do is  play gta v on moderate to high graphics (as opposed to ultra high) without mods, you should look into consoles. If you aren't concerned with inflated game prices, or are a stickler for game cases and memorabilia, you should look into consoles. It really depends on the person and on what they value most. I like having control over the games I play, having low game prices, and being able to play at the highest video quality.

Not the case these days, you have to pre-order it or buy DLC.\nThe fact that people are saying \"if you don't want it, don't buy it\" is just an apathetic view thats damaging consumers as there are people who still pay to get ahead, feeding on thr need of quick gratification, we should be fighting this.\nDLC could work if it was expanding the game ala expansion packs, adding to the game instead of blocking 10% of a game because MONEY."], "type": ["COMMENT"]}

It also means that if a company decides that they want to expand profits, they can cut aspects of the game that are already developed/finished so they can release them later JUST for the sake of more profit.\nRemember the nonsense a while ago with Mass Effect 3, which gated off a character that was \"part\" of some DLC.  That character, however, was accessible to the base game via editing one line of text.\nIt's not that DLC is bad, and it's not that paying for vanity things is bad.  DLC like the stuff for Skyrim was worth it, and things like LoL skins are optional things you get if you want them.  The issue is that, again, encouraging heavy DLC/microtransaction usage in games gives reason for companies to cut content specifically to release at a later time for more profits, or through some stupid mechanic that they know players will regularly pay for."], "type": ["COMMENT"]}

When you first fight the garg, you assume it's going to be a 1v1 battle, and all is well until phase 2 when you suddenly have to manage the other asshole. I think most players, at this stage of playing darksouls, were accustomed to locking on to every threat too. This fight teaches you that locking on isn't always the best strategy, but to also be aware of your surroundings. I believe there are ~3 possible encounters that will have you engage in +1 enemies before gargs; so that lack of experience is what makes gargs harder than they should be. "], "type": ["COMMENT"]}
