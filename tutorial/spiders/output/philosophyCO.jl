And although it doesn't say exactly, it's likely one of the more challenging aspects of having it more widely adopted.  It sounds as though questions are asked in a socratic way which would definitely be radical.  It would be a shift in the onus of judgment of answers from the teacher to the students.  With this kind of a shift, the externalized correctness of answers loses significance.\nHaving said that, one of the things that commonly gets left off the table when drawing up a school curriculum is the presupposed assumption of measurement.  The paradigm that students appeal their answers to an external source for the sake of grading.  And regardless of how useful that paradigm is, it doesn't have the power to address the problem of what is implicitly learned - that the student's answers aren't for themselves.  The answers are to placate teachers, parents, and possibly future employers.\nSo essentially, we can teach a kid to clean his room by demonstrating it and telling him to do it.  We can then make sure it's clean by measuring the state of the room.  But what we can't do is determine whether or not he wants it that way.  And until we give up on measurement as a proof of education in at least some areas, we will never be able to pass on the benefits of a clean room.  "], "type": ["COMMENT"]}

Echoing quintessentially Kierkegaardian themes, de Silentio claims that such faith, if it exists, \u201cfaintly sees an object on the most distant [infinite??] horizon but is separated from it by a chasmal abyss in which doubt plays its tricks\u201d (p. 20).\nFurther, as Kierkegaard notes, Abraham\u2019s special test\u2014the \n\u2014comes to an end. Abraham gets Isaac back (in the sense that he doesn\u2019t have to sacrifice him), and that test is not repeated. But Abraham\u2019s God-relationship doesn\u2019t abruptly end once he has passed that test. For eschatological faith is the task of a lifetime and thus is never rendered gratuitous in this life. Even de Silentio himself recognizes this component of faith, writing that ancient, biblical faith \u201cwas then a task for a whole lifetime, because it was assumed that proficiency in believing is not acquired either in days or in weeks\u201d (p. 7). Kierkegaard\u2019s point could be put this way: if de Silentio\u2019s concept of faith does \n (and rightly) make it the task of a lifetime, it has to have an eschatological object to guarantee that it is and remains the task of a lifetime and not something that could, at least in principle, be terminated \n.\nNevertheless, de Silentio is right to argue that an eschatological dimension of faith is in vain if it is \n eschatological\u2014i.e., if it fails to regain its focus on here-and-now actuality. De Silentio remarks, \u201cTo me God\u2019s love \u2026\u00a0is incommensurable with the whole of actuality. \u2026 I am happy and satisfied, but my joy is not the joy of faith, and by comparison with that, it is unhappy. \u2026 Faith is convinced that God is concerned about the smallest things\u201d (p. 34). For the knight of faith, God\u2019s love is \n incommensurable with actuality. The joy of faith is genuinely happy \n it trusts God\u2019s loving presence even in the smallest, the messiest, the ugliest parts of existence. Hence de Silentio: \u201cSpiritually speaking, everything is possible, but in the finite world there is much that is not possible\u201d (p. 44). What faith does is brings spiritual possibility to bear against finitude\u2019s impossibilities. For the Christian, that means living on the basis of a promised future even in the often unpromising present.\nWhat then, of your question, \u201cIs it so obviously absurd though to believe one will get it in eternity (understood as an eternal afterlife)? We don't know anything about the next life, for instance, so we might get anything in it!\u201d Unfortunately, \u2018anything\u2019 could be good \n bad. Consider one of the common objections to Pascal\u2019s Wager: what if you put your faith in the wrong God! The infinite passion of eschatological faith is not a matter of mere hope for eternity, but of hope for a \n eternity, an eternity in which all things are set right. Even if, from the standpoint of natural reason, one could argue that we have a soul and that it is intrinsically immortal, that wouldn\u2019t guarantee a \n immortality. So, if the \n requires an \u201cabsurd\u201d belief in God\u2019s special intervention in either revoking his requirement or miraculously resurrecting Isaac, how much more \u201cabsurd\u201d then is God\u2019s granting us perfect happiness (which, for the Christian, involves his gracious\u2014i.e., not entitled\u2014offer of forgiveness)? For this would entail, on the Christian view, another special intervention\u2014one which leads not to another finite good that will again be lost (after all, Isaac did eventually die), but instead an infinite good, and one which has consequences not only for future (post-Isaac) generations, but for all generations past, present, and future.\nThere is another component to bringing together eternity and temporality, the future and the present, which Kierkegaard does not adequately thematize. On the Christian view, eternity is more than a purely spiritual afterlife. It is one involving physical resurrection and a renewal of material creation. In this sense the hope for eternity gives us an inexhaustible fund of things to hope for\u2014and \u2018hope for\u2019 not idly but in the existentially empowering sense of \u2018hope\u2019 intended by Kierkegaard \n in the Christian tradition.\nI hope (no pun intended) that this also answers your point that \u201cthere seem to be a great many people who have this kind of faith for an afterlife. Surely they're not Kierkegaardian knights of faith!\u201d If they do not actively strive to live out such a faith, if their eschatological trust is an intellectual figment and not an existential here-and-now reality, they are fooling themselves. In such a case, Kierkegaard would recommend careful and honest self-examination. For not until we are honest about what we claim to believe, and where we ourselves are with respect to the content\u2014practical no less than propositional\u2014\n those beliefs, can we truly claim to have a faith that is more than an empty \u201cpromissory note.\u201d"], "type": ["COMMENT"]}

Yet I find the beauty about the writing in Genesis is that it is heavy on import while frugal on detail, inviting us to fill in the gaps or rather flesh out the story.\nMay I offer a different perspective of Abraham? It was just ten generations earlier that Noah was floating in his ark on an endless sea surrounded by the bloated bodies of all but a few fellow human beings. Consider his behaviour post flood, the drunkenness and lewd conduct unbecoming hint very much at classic PTS.\nDespite the covenant from God, to never to wreak destruction on the human race through flood again, Abraham was witness to the destruction of  Sodom and Gomorrah through fire from heaven. He had done his best to negotiate the sparing of these two towns but failed. One can only imagine his despair and dread at their obliteration. God seemed to be yet again on a murderous rampage and goodness only knows what would take to appease him?\nThe answer came quite quickly, Abraham is asked to sacrifice his son, his gift from God. One gets a sense of a \u2018Sophie\u2019s choice\u2019. One thing we know from the earlier descriptions and actions of Abraham is that he quickly realises the options set before him. There is no argument nor bargaining this time. He took his son and his knife to do what was needed to appease. Shouldn't his actions in this different but not illegitimate perspective be deemed heroic rather than devotional? Would one ever consider sacrificing a son to prevent a holocaust? That was the choice before him.\nThe telling passage for me is Genesis 22:12 \"Do not lay a hand on the boy,\" he said. \"Do not do anything to him. Now I know that you fear God, because you have not withheld from me your son, your only son.\"\nNote the word FEAR, not devotion nor worship nor love. It is easy to consider Abraham\u2019s actions shaming a rampaging God. It should also be noted that God does not directly address Abraham but the conversation was conducted via an angel.\nYou wrote \u201cBut Abraham\u2019s God-relationship doesn\u2019t abruptly end once he has passed that test.\u201d I may be wrong but there is no indication of Abraham ever directly speaking to God again, nor indeed of him ever speaking to Isaac or Ishmael. It would have been an interesting conversation between the two when they met again to bury their father.\nWe are left with the impression of great trauma dealt to all parties but also of a power shift and an adjustment occurring in the relationship between God and his chosen people. \nFurther there is a sense of a maturing God. Karen Armstrong, quite rightly I feel asserts \u201cinstead of seeing God as just an adult, you can also see God as a child\u201d \nI recall the story of one of the great Talmudists, a Professor Lieberman asking a student, \"Who was the most tragic character in the bible?\" After several unsatisfactory answers Lieberman says \u201cNo, the most tragic character in the Bible is God.\u201d \nThis is the theme which continues in Job and one that seems to be lost on both Kierkegaard and di Silentio.\nEdit: words"], "type": ["COMMENT"]}

Fifty righteous, 45, 40, 30, 20, 10\u2014need Abraham have stopped there in his negotiating? Need he have framed his negotiation in terms of righteousness and justice to begin with, instead of compassion and mercy? Perhaps the tragic character of God lies not in some childishness of God, but in his people\u2019s supposing him childish and expecting so little of him.\n\u201cWould one ever consider sacrificing a son to prevent a holocaust? That was the choice before him.\u201d There seems no clear alternate object of God\u2019s wrath in your reading of this narrative. More importantly, unlike the story of Sodom and Gomorrah, here it is said that \u201cGod tested Abraham\u201d (Gen. 22:1).\nAs for your focus on \u2018fear\u2019, I don\u2019t take this to be fear in a wholly negative sense. Abraham himself uses it positively in Gen. 20:11: \u201cI did it because I thought, There is no fear of God at all in this place, and they will kill me because of my wife.\u201d\nThe continuance of Abraham\u2019s God-relationship need not involve God\u2019s \u201cdirectly speaking\u201d to him again. It is reported that when Abraham was \u201cold, well advanced in years,\u201d God \u201chad blessed Abraham in all things\u201d (Gen. 24:1; cf. vv. 27, 35). There is no record of him speaking again to Abraham. But Isaac does pray and his prayer is granted (Gen. 25:21) and God does speak directly to his wife Rebekah (vv. 22-23) and twice to him (Gen. 26:2-5,24).\n\u201cWe are left with the impression of great trauma dealt to all parties\u201d\u2014what signs of this have you in mind? There seems to be a rather clear sense of blessing, both for Abraham and for Isaac (Gen. 22:17-18; 24:1,27,35; 25:11; 26:3-5,12-13,24,27-29).\nAlso remember that, whereas Abraham had failed to trust God at several previous junctures (Gen. 12:18, 17:17, 20:1\u201313), God remained faithful on each occasion (12:20, 21:1\u20132, 20:17\u201318, respectively). This gives us a basis for understanding how Abraham could trust God concerning Isaac. Because God had repeatedly promised to \u201cmake nations\u201d of Abraham (17:6) \n Isaac (17:19\u201321; 21:12), Abraham had good reason to think that God would either rescind his command to offer Isaac as a burnt offering, or restore him to life if the command is not rescinded. According to an early Christian reading of this narrative (Heb. 11:17\u201319), the latter is Abraham\u2019s reasoning. De Silentio allows for both options, remarking that Abraham \u201chad faith that God would not demand Isaac of him, and yet he was willing to sacrifice him if it was demanded\u201d; \u201cGod could give him a new Isaac, could restore to life the one sacrificed\u201d (Hongs\u2019 trans., pp. 35, 36).\nLastly, perhaps the test was intended to be, as one Jewish reading of the \n has it, an object lesson for God\u2019s people: \u201cIn that age, it was astounding that Abraham\u2019s God should have interposed \n the sacrifice, not that He should have asked for it. A primary purpose of this command, therefore, was to demonstrate to Abraham and his descendants after him that God abhorred human sacrifice with an infinite abhorrence\u201d (Rabbi Joseph H. Hertz, \n, p. 201). This dramatic reversal seems far more effective than simply issuing a command against child sacrifice. (This reading doesn\u2019t appear on de Silentio\u2019s radar, but it\u2019s worth considering.)"], "type": ["COMMENT"]}

Similarly, one need not be a Christian to know whether or not Kierkegaard is compatible with dominant traditions within orthodox Christian teaching.\nFourth, you speak as though there is one single \u201cJewish view.\u201d There isn\u2019t\u2014and \n when it comes to the \n. As Louis Jacobs observes, \u201cThree different attitudes to the problem have been adopted by Jewish thinkers. The first stresses the story\u2019s \u2018happy ending\u2019\u2026 The second\u2026 the original command. This view, very close to Kierkegaard\u2019s attitude, can imagine God commanding Abraham to slay his son\u2026 A third\u2026 seeks to dwell on both aspects of the narrative\u201d (\u2018The Problem of the \n in Jewish Thought\u2019 in \n, ed. Perkins, pp. 1-2). Consequently, even if Kierkegaard and/or de Silentio disagrees with one tradition within Judaism, that does not suffice to demonstrate his disagreement with all of them.\nFifth, according to Jacobs, \u201cThe analysis\u2026 given by Moses Maimonides\u2026 comes very close to the Kierkegaardian understanding. Maimonides[!] observes that the \n teaches\u2026 that man, out of the love and fear of God, is obliged to go even to the limits to which Abraham was prepared to go. According to Maimonides\u2019 reading of the \n, the \u2018test\u2019 was not in order to provide God with information about Abraham\u2019s steadfastness that God did not possess, but rather it was to provide a \u2018test case\u2019 of the limits to which a man can and should go in his love for God\u2026\u201d (ibid., pp. 5-6).\nSixth, Jacobs cites the Orthodox Jewish teacher Professor J.B. Soloveitchick as \u201cthe most determined exponent of a Kierkegaardian interpretation of the \n.\u201d Soloveitchick \u201cobserves that the midrash\u2026 in which Abraham\u2019s dialogue with Satan conveys all the anguish and uncertainty of the man of faith, is much closer to Kierkegaard than any idea of religion as offering \u2018peace of mind\u2019\u201d (p. 6).\nSeventh, and getting us back on topic\u2026 I noted that Kierkegaard is in fact in error, and hermeneutically short-sighted, when it comes to Judaism, but this does not necessarily mean he \u201chad a wildly innacurate conception of Judaism.\u201d I would argue that he did and he didn\u2019t, and that we cannot say much more than that unless we focus on specifics.\nLastly, part of my argument is that, even independent of Kierkegaard\u2019s understanding of \n conceptions of Judaism (which, again, cannot be reduced to a single conception), his view of \n is flawed \n."], "type": ["COMMENT"]}

A big part of productive debate is to look deeper than the face value of the question. \"Should gun ownership be a right?\" is not a good question to debate\u2014it's little different than \"Is this painting ugly?\" In cases like this, the real question being argued is always something more fundamental, political or not. Getting to the actual, underlying conflict is always more productive.\nOne of the reasons political debates often seem never-ending and unsolvable is because there's so much to \n to get to the actual conflict. Consider abortion, for example: Should abortion be legalized?\nThere are resounding yeses and nos. There are claims about women's rights, claims about the rights of a fetus. There are touching stories and gruesome pictures thrown around. There are horrifying parallels and logic-breaking metaphors, but I'm going to cut to the chase and get to the real question. The \n question is more general, yet simpler than the ambiguous, abstract \"pro-life\" and \"pro-choice\" political nonsense: \nMind you, this question in and of itself isn't perfect, has a lot of scary gray area, and is not an easy question to answer, but it's a start. For example, most people generally agree that an adult has passed that stage of development. Some people (pro-abortion) think life's value comes months after conception, while others (anti-abortion) think life's value comes \n conception. We can proceed to ask these parties: \"Why does the value of life come at [this] time?\" or \"What definitive moment does this value manifest?\" and test their answers for consistency with other scenarios. \nHere's an example of an abortion-conversation for anyone interested (but you can stop reading here if you don't care). My girlfriend, brother, and I were having a discussion about abortion, and got to the above question. My answer was:\n\"At the point where the fetus-baby-thing can live \n of the mother without dying.\"\nI was presented with various examples and questions challenging this logic. The most potent of which was something along the lines of \"Should abortion be totally illegal when technology is sufficient such that we can raise a sperm and egg into a fully developed baby in a mechanical tube?\" In order for my views to remain consistent, the answer to this question \n yes. If I feel it is no, then my above-provided answer is inconsistent and needs to be amended (added to, changed completely, etc.).\nMy girlfriend's answer, on the other hand, was:\n\"At the point of conception.\"\nShe isn't religious, nor does she think much of a fetus, but this line is the easiest possible line to maintain consistency (next to: \"we should never value life\" :P). It's a simple, robust, black-and-white rule that answers well to a wide variety of situations. So, my resultant line of questioning was not focused on revealing inconsistency\u2014instead, it orbited around whether or not this maximizes for \"good\" (a seemingly super-vague term that we rigorously defined on the car ride home; before the discussion, we concluded that social policies should maximize for \"good\").\nAnyway, this conversation, which attempted to answer the \n question behind the abortion issue, was a lot more insightful than \"pro-life\" and \"pro-choice\" rhetoric that take up so much of common \"debate.\""], "type": ["COMMENT"]}

However, postmodernism remains a complete mystery to me, and my sincere belief is that it is a fraud. Listening to this has only confirmed my impression.\nThe podcast gives the following completely absurd analysis of language:\nThe speaker then concludes:\nIt seems to me that it all goes the other way around.\nDoes language affect the way we view the world at all? Yes, sure. Language enforces certain ways to look at things, by putting certain different things under a single label, allowing certain constructions and not others, and so on. Is language an arbitrary social construct existing independently from the world and giving it meaning? No; we wouldn't be able to learn language if it worked that way. Any power given to language comes by virtue of the worldly origin of meaning.\nThe power of a language disappears as that language is disconnected from the world. Indeed, meaning evolves to reflect the situations in which a word is used, or \"misused\". This is why the meanings of words don't always respect their etymology. A simple example: breakfast no longer refers to breaking a fast; it is just the first meal of the day, and you possibly never thought of it in any other way. This is also the limit of postmodernism. That limit is very quickly reached, and postmodernism only seems revolutionary by pretending that the small leeway between the structure of the world and the structure of its description, afforded to us by language, goes all the way to infinity.\nSo, life is only arbitrary art if you can afford to disconnect yourself from the world. A condition that applies to my country's (France) ex-marxist tenured philosophy professors, and not to many others. Someone, below, is asking \"who are we to say that Rachel Dolezal is not black?\". The answer is, we are people who have learned language in the world, and that has taught us what \"black\" (referring to a person) means. Based on this, we can say that no, she is definitely not black; or perhaps that yes, she is black if she decides she is. Either way, it is not arbitrary."], "type": ["COMMENT"]}

Our individual subjective experiences of trees in the environment and how our language is socialized through our close associates and media we consume can be very different resulting in two very different and subjective \"meanings\" of the word TREE. \nLet me break apart your compound sentence for further analysis: You say \"Is language an arbitrary social construct existing independently from the world? No.\" So you're saying language is not an invented human construct? It literally, objectively exists even if humans didn't exist? Does language exist on Mars?

It's just a breakdown of the hierarchy of systems of signs we use to refer to the world in order of their complexity. I don't think there's any way we'll ever really be able to know how exactly language came to be. \nWith respect to whether or not it's arbitrary, I think it's pretty obvious that it is. If it wasn't, there wouldn't be as many languages in the world as there are. If there were an inherent connection between a tree and the word 'tree', every language in the world would call it a 'tree'. Issues of translating meaning between certain phrases or words in one language to another would be non-existent. But there are, that's because language is a social construct. When people began naming things, we could just as easily have started using the word 'dog' to refer to a 'tree'. It's just an accident of history that we didn't.\nWith respect to assigning meanings to objects in the world (like 'mom') before we learn the word for that object...I don't know, I'm kind of with you there. It does seem like, developmentally speaking, we have associations before we learn words, although I'm not sure if that's really what they're trying to get into here.\nTo address your last point about Rachel Dolezal, he actually makes the same point in the podcast when he says that truth isn't objective, it's based on consensus. He's not saying that anyone can just decide any word means whatever they want it to mean for them personally. He's saying that, insofar as the majority of English speaking people have decided that the word 'black' communicates a certain association of ideas when it's used with respect to the color of a person's skin, it has a certain meaning. It's partially meant as a description of their skin pigmentation, which I guess is an objective quality? But that's not all we mean when we say someone is 'black', and that meaning absolutely is arbitrary and socially constructed. "], "type": ["COMMENT"]}

To abridge and stay efficient I'll just add a couple addendums to some of the other responses which hit key themes of context, culture, and social impact on interpretation. \nPost-modern art weighs less on skills in some respects because of it's deconstructed nature. The contemporary artist isn't exclusively a painter, sculptor, photographer but rather just an artist who chooses the best medium to represent their idea. This is paramount to contemporary art due to historical mediums having so much context associated with them that the medium alone injects certain ideas and representations. The artist's exploration of expression prompted shifts in medium and technology over the past 100+ years and while many believe technology killed art I like to think it's just been a slow and inevitable evolution to determine what the role of an artist is.\nMany contemporary artists regard those that weigh skill over concept as just crafts people and hobbyists. One of my professors would always quip \"anyone can learn to draw, take pictures, mix color, and form clay\" drawing a line between production artist and artist. I personally agree with this mindset and extend it to my students now. An example I like to use that hits on post-modern process is seeing someone paint a photo-realistic painting of someone because they identify as a painter and asking \"Why is this a painting and not a photograph?\". With the answers to the likes of \"because I'm a painter\" not being valid in the post-modern world. Of course, this is a very simplified example. \nPost-modern art relies heavily on the individual, as well as their social and cultural background. To simplify, I think modern art typically has a specific idea in mind to convey to the viewer (this work is about x) | post-modern art possesses the artist's idea and embraces an unknown reaction based on individual response (this work is about x+y). Of course, this is a crudely truncated and potentially narrow summation of my thoughts on those differences.\nAdopting the \"I like a, so b is shit\" mindset tends to close off great discussions in general, but there are a lot of artists that identify as post-modern or contemporary that put a great deal of labor and craft into their work. To mention a few that use photography often for its context are Sandy Skoglund, Thomas Demand, and Gregory Crewdson, perhaps you'll find their work is more up your alley. "], "type": ["COMMENT"]}

And if this cannot be solved than the whole elaboration and reformulation of the core inconsistency doesn't add a lot insight imho.... \nEpikurs arguments can be reformulated into three propositions: \nA) god is almighty, omniscient and eternal \nB) god is benevolent \nC) evil exists \nThe core here is the porblem of a classical trilemma: Only two of these propositions (any combination) can be true - the third always poses a contradiction. \nSo if A) and B) are true then there cannot be evil. Meaning everything we perceive as evil must be good (as in gods plan). If evil is truly good by gods standards then there is no evil - it's a human illusion (we just don't understand... heard that one before? yep....). \nThis is basically the short version of step 18) from the article. But it suffices - I do not see what any elaboration adds here to the argument. \nIf A) and C) are true then god can't be benevolent. \nWhich is just the counter-position to the last conclusion. Note that for C) to be true it is necessary to add \"by gods standards\" directly related to gods standard of good (needed for the attribute of benevolence to make any sense at all!). \nHuman standards do not matter here at all - it is an argument about a supposed almighty, benevolent entity. Though it is the analytical strength of the trilemma that it actually doesn't matter which standards we apply to the argument - as long as we apply the same in all three statements. \nJust like in mathematics where you write all your premises above the whole problem to make sure you do not switch any definitions in any step towards the solution. \nNice and lazy thing about logic in comparison to math is: we do not even have to define anything here as we do not need to solve the problem. We just need to show it's a true trilemma in the sense that the three propositions can't all be true at the same time - no matter the definition of evil at hand. The contents of the concepts for good and for evil are completely irrelevant to the argument - as long as it stays the same over B) and C) (and benevolence means to always choose good instead of evil of course). \nWhat about B) and C)? Well if god is benevolent and still there's evil then it follows that he, she or it is not omnipotent at all or misjudged the situation (not omniscient) or isn't there all the time (no eternal presence)... \nSo here we are: - at statement 20) from the article, just fewer words.... \nBtw, I think 21) is a useless and unnecessary assumption. It's at most persuasive and doesn't hold up to the analytical quality of the argument. \nNow the whole free will debate is also nothing else as a shift in the meaning of good and evil during the discussion. Can't do that. \nIf free will is the greater good (and causes some \"evil\" in the world) than this \"evil\" is not so evil at all as it serves the greater good. One has to stick to the standard of the line above. Otherwise is just rhetorical trickery.... Sophisticated but still treacherous. \nThe argument of free will hinges on the assumption of \"necessary evil\" to allow for the good (people choosing the \"right thing to do\" as stated). But if the necessary evil is just a side effect of free will to allow the possibility of true good deeds (note here: done by persons!) then \na) we are also talking of the evil done by persons \nb) god must be sure that this free will is for the \"good\"  - but here \"good\" is not the good doings of persons but in a godly sense \nAs one can see - it's a trick, a shift in meaning. By the way: if the \"evil\" done by persons is just a side effect of the great godly \"good\" than it is not the opposite of this \"good\" but just a mere property of it. \nOne could say that god creates the most \"good\" world by his, its or her standards by creating persons with free will. They will do good things and as tolerated side effect also evil deeds (by different standards here). That is the best god can do, it is also the only possible way to create this best world by gods standards. \nDoesn't mean it's perfect. Occasional evil to some degree is a property of this world - so evil in this sense is a property of the goodness of gods world and not it's logical opposite. Evil in this sense is part of the goodness. \nThere is one standard for \"good\" for creating the worlds W1 to W4 and another one, a different meaning of \"good\" and \"evil\" within these worlds. Many words but in the end just a trick, a cunning play with different perspectives or different logical relations of the terms \"good\" and \"evil\". \nNow the natural evil argument is yet another standard shift. If natural evil is part of the best possible world than it cannot be evil by the same standard as the world is good. It's just a necessary inconvenience, a property of this best world which sadly either just isn't perfect or is necessary to the \"good world\" as god sees it (see above)... \nIn my opinion the whole Platinga \"defense\" cannot do anything to save the logical inconsistency. There is always a shift in meaning and perspective during the walk through the lines of the argument and adding more words and twists might make the defense more persuasive but in the end it just doesn't cut it. \nDo it like math. Write a definition of exactly what you mean by good and evil above the trilemma. Then follow the argumentation and double check on every step if the argument still works with the original defintion.

That is the logical relation I tried to express here. \nSo I have to stick to my claim: Platinga in his argument uses the terms \"good\" and \"evil\" each in two different meanings, two different scopes and even two different relations, one time related to \"what god should do\" and the other time related to what persons should do. \nIt's a trap. \nthx for reading, p."], "type": ["COMMENT"]}
