We'd love to give you a sneak peek behind the scenes at how we create these planets, so we\u2019re hosting a livestream next week with a couple of our lead artists (keep an eye on our social media channels for where the stream will be hosted). On Wednesday October 14, at 7PM BST, we'll show you some early development footage of the icy and rocky worlds in motion. This peek behind the scenes will demonstrate the simulation technology that we've been working on to create the captivating \u201cEuropa lines\u201d for the ice worlds and canyons, and the craters and mountains for the rocky worlds. Simulation has always been important within the Elite Dangerous galaxy, and our conversation with the artists will highlight the accuracy, depth and technical prowess that go into creating the impressive features that make up our worlds. We'll talk through the base-scientific principle that the simulation has been built on in order to shape these beautiful, real worlds.

The acquisition of wealth was incredibly monotonous and unengaging.  A rares one, back when the routes were all fresh and everyone hadn't started draining the supply to nil, you could make 2 or 3 million in a couple hours of jetting around in a Cobra MkII.  And it was Boring.  As.  Sin. All of the other activities in the game had almost no appreciable payout.  Commodities trading felt pointless without at least 200 tons of cargo space, and even then it was repetitive and monotonous.  Where the game really shines is the combat, but blowing up ships in a conflict zone for 5-10k per kill felt like buying a yacht to go comb beaches with a metal detector in hunt of pennies and nickles. So, as a player wanting to experience the interesting content and experiment with all the different ship types and playstyles available in this game, I was looking at an incredibly pointless 40+ hour grind. To be honest, I regretted my purchase at 60$.  It's a beautiful universe simulator they'd created, but a far less enjoyable experience.  The only ways to accomplish meaningful progression were boring as sin, and the most enjoyable activities paid so poorly that they were a horrible way to progress. I quit and didn't play again for more than 10 months. Since I hopped on to check out 1.4, and discovered smuggling as a viable source of relatively exciting gameplay AND income ->  avoiding interdictions, hiding from scans, slipping through station checkpoints, fighting off unwanted encounters, all of a sudden I was progressing in the game AND enjoying the process of doing it.  I tripled my net value in a couple trips, and got to try out new ships.  I could finally afford an A class hyperdrive!  It was bliss. Now I'm seeing people complaining about \"Imbalanced\"  \"Nerf the smuggling\"  yada yada. Well, as a casual player who does not want to do tons of boring shit to arrive at interesting content, Frontier won't get another dime for me if they do that.  I'm not making demands, I'm voting with my wallet.  I can respect more hardcore players who are annoyed at how their massive fortunes can be more realistically matched by newer players in less time, but for me  being able to make good money doing something exciting in a 2-3 hour play session means the difference between me playing this game and buying expansions, or not.

{"text": ["The depth is a joke, world interaction is a lulzy number meta at best, there is no WORLD to Elite.  It's just pilots and shooting things.  What lore is there in HAZRES?  Why is there an arbitrary reason that these HAZRES sites have the best mining locations?   All the mission texts are canned, boring, and stupidly repetitive.  And you know what bothers me the most?  The founders/elite ranked missions have more text than all the lower ranked ones combined.  It's     The game excels in letting you do different things to your whimsy so you can't ever get bored, but it's also hard to get the same \"rush\" or thrill as the initial experience because of just how little depth it all has but they're still fun. In short, it's like a drug that you can take a break from and still keep playing.  Combat is obviously the most fleshed out, but it's \"intensive\" if you go to the right areas, so once you're burned out on that, you can relax with trading or, by going out to explore the galaxy.  Then once you get bored of that, start killing things again.  There's a wave of high stimulation and low stimulation available, and that's what keeps people playing Elite, including myself.  Elite is just so impersonal.  I like the fact I'm a lone shitty commander in the middle of a sprawling civilization, but then I realize there's nothing else.  You're a pilot.  Here's a couple places.  Things are happening but you're so far removed it's like they were never there to begin with.   That's my problem with Elite.  Nothing's happening as a universe.  For all the work and depth put into it, which I greatly respect, the ultimate result for me is somewhat disappointing.  I feel no different than any other commander in the universe.  I'm no better, I'm no worse.  PVP's there, yeah, but what am I going to do with it?   But, ultimately it's what you make of it, and personally, I'm growing more and more jaded.   Tl;dr, Elite is way too impersonal, as CMDRs are so far removed from any small events in the world (say, a mass murderer in a station, terrorism, etc) that there's really no reason to give a shit about anything you do except get money, get rep, get ships, and get grudges with other ships.  And I love my space ships and all, but I'm getting that \"what's the point\" feeling once again.  The result of \"what's the point\" will be me doing an RP Python armed with plenty of weapons and a compact Power Plant, with exploration equipment and a cargo bay, to set off for the other side of the galaxy, because if I'm going to be lonely in space, at least I'll make it a part of my immersion.   Wow that was a rambling.  Yay.   Edit:  You want to know why I still play Elite?  Because I am literally roleplaying with one other friend, who seems to be the only other goddamn person in this entire game to not give a shit about getting 2300123million credits per hour.  He grinded his way to a Clipper and is ready to set sail to the other side of the galaxy because he could give less of a shit about the money, and I'm about to join him as soon as I finish outfitting my Python.   Everyone else runs around looking for the fastest ways to make credits because for some reason currency in games is like everyone's space Heroin.  45 million credits for 3.5 hours of work?   I'm looking at these numbers and I feel like any money I make is stupidly trivialized.  I have no incentive to make millions because    My ASP is already A rated, my Python is already super powerful with 5-7 million credits worth of investment, and sure I can't do PVP but I've been hazresing since I first got it and slapped some weapons and an A6 power distributor on it.  The only thing I have going for me is upgrading my Python and then that's it.  Sure I might get the money to blow elsewhere but then money becomes a joke for me.  My pilot amassing millions used to mean something, now it's me treating it like an MMO resource grind.   Everyone's doing the same optimal method to get money because they   right now.  HAZRES and Sothis.  Get hundreds of millions a week.  Get any ship you want.  Then what?  What else is there now?  Is there a reason for me to care?   Christ.  More rant.   Edit 4:  Deleted additional rant.  Tl;dr of old rant, what's the point of making 12 million credits an hour when everyone else is doing it?  What does it all mean in the scope of the game?  But, maybe just knowing other people making that much money just ruins the game for me (regarding min maxing bullshit), so I'll try and turn a blind eye to this subreddit because I know I can never convince other people to think otherwise, and that's alright I suppose.  A part of me hates that the game will develop in one way because I am not the majority, but do your thing.  After all, this is a game.

Every once in a while you would find an Anaconda worth 100k.  Woohoo!  And the combat in this game is fun. But being able to make what is arguably very sub-optimal income enjoying fun combat related missions and activities, required a lot of money sunk into your ship.  That also means a much bigger buyback cost if you get blown up.  You can still easily blow 5 million credits on a smaller assault ship without even fitting it out at A-class tier.  And that small ship is going to take ages to get through an Anaconda or Python's shields with its smaller guns.  Those larger ships were generally 10X the bounty of smaller ships and around the threshhold where blowing shit up for cash begins to   not being a waste of time financially.  So there you have it - the \"Holy Grail\" of an Elite Dangerous Perma Scrub pre 1.4:  \"If only I can earn 80 million credits so I can eventually make   doing something that isn't less exciting than  \" A year ago, every time I'd dock and look at a shipyard and see the price tags next to some of the other spaceboats out there and my stomach would drop.  I'd consider trying to fit something other than pulse lasers or multicannons, and then I'd see that the two c2 missile launchers would set me back a whole million and I only had 500k. So then it would be back to rares runs, scraping a couple measly units together at each system in between flying for an hour each way in my ship that can only jump 12-15 lys at a time and takes 3 minutes to refuel every fourth or fifth jump.  Would've fallen asleep doing that multiple times if it weren't for the fact that gets you accelerated into a star and blown up exiting hyperspace. Resource Extraction Sites?  I used to fly around them and occasionally see a few bounties in the 30k range.  Hazardous ones are new.  Back when I last played, you had to do the \"Cargo Scoop Fun Time Extravaganza\" to mine rocks, and I'd rather pluck nose hairs.  I've tried the collector limpets, but in an hour of mining and prospecting a resource extraction site I made less than 200k.  So this 10-20 mil an hour you speak of either needs a better ship (bounties) or is some mythical place with great resource drops (mining). Bottom line is, things like the Smuggling Missions are fun, they provide a sense of progression to the game, and they give larger numbers of people more reasons to play and enjoy by making more content accessible to them.  If it gets nerfed, I can't imagine any other reason for it beside Frontier's design philosophy being overtly \"Anti Fun\".  It already seemed that way before - the Steam reviews on Steam release?  I can't be the only one who wasn't entirely surprised by that, after playing 10-12 hours a week for 3 weeks and having less than 5 million net worth. Whatever, everyone is entitled to enjoy what they will and maintain their own standards for their gaming pasttimes.  I would be very frustrated if income is nerfed back into stupid, because I just found this fun-carpet and I don't want it swept out from under me."], "hyperlink": ["https://www.reddit.com/r/EliteDangerous/comments/3orvhw/i_bought_this_game_a_year_ago_and_havent_enjoyed/cw05aq1"]},

{"text": ["Really? You can go from a stock sidewinder to a vulture (6mil credits) in a day without smuggling, taking advantage of PP Bounty rewards, rares etc. just by flying in resource extraction sites. Admittedly this takes the advance knowledge of knowing that early trading / missions tend to suck. I personally got my first cobra through 10+ hours of same-system trading runs, without using/selling my freagle, but I had a ~700k worth Cobra and a Type 6 (without selling the cobra) maybe two and a half hours after I started doing combat. I primarily played with a buddy (before wings) and there were no shortage of high bounty targets in our resource extraction sites. Load up in your stock sidewinder, go and get ~15k in the bank through missions, trading (shit I just said sucked, but bear with me), L/HRES, Nav Beacons etc. Buy some gimballed pulse or gimballed burst lasers (6.6k - 8.6k) and go find a HRES. Bounties are MUCH better than they used to be, so finding 80k+ targets is really easy. Wait for the feds (or whoever owns your system) to start shooting pirates and then just pick the pirates off. After 15 minutes of this you should have enough for a Cobra (if you even want it). At ~450k you can get a really sweet Cobra and at about ~600k you can buy all the upgrades you want unless you're A-ranking everything. A cobra can fuck with almost everything in a LRES and most things in an HRES, and will make it possible to fight a lot of pirates without system authority. Keep doing RES until you can afford a Type 6, or an Asp, or a Vulture or whatever you want in the low millions range. Most of the bigger ships can enter HazRES without worrying or you could trade, smuggle etc. Edit: I just reset my cmdr to see how quickly I could get up to a Vulture and smuggling seems viable from the get-go. 250k mission from the start station. depending on your experience you may need to upgrade your FSD first (so probably upgrade to hauler as it has a really good jump range) to get out of your system though."], "hyperlink": ["https://www.reddit.com/r/EliteDangerous/comments/3orvhw/i_bought_this_game_a_year_ago_and_havent_enjoyed/cw07aa4"]},

{"url": ["/r/EliteDangerous/comments/3oro6f/ed_should_do_content_like_this_sothis/"], "text": ["I am a beta backer, having been through my fair share of content by Elite Dangerous. This is the most fun that I have had in Elite in a long time. I consider it very High Risk High Yield, in both money and time spent. You really do risk losing everything 2 hours in, making absolutely nothing and having to start over. That's a very engaging risk, and the reward is quite comparable.  I am currently Tycoon trading ranked, and usually just play ED to zone out for a bit. I listen to audio books and trade mindlessly a simple route in my Anaconda. I've done the route so many times that if you asked me what station I was in or what was in my cargo at the time, I couldn't tell you. It's the same route I have traded since I was in an Asp. It's all just muscle memory. I have no fears at all while trading. Even if some pirates interdicted me, they'd be blown to bits, but I cannot remember the last pirate interdiction I got. I actually enjoy this aspect to the game, I am not wishing it to go away, but ED has always just been a sort of meditation for me, not so much a challenge or \"game.\" I heard word of Sothis, and figures of 20m-40m an hour. I had to see for myself. I was around and was able to do the rare trading, back when it was clearly BS, this sounded like it might be a lot like that, by what people were saying, but I found it to be nothing like that at all. Here's my account of the situation:  https://forums.frontier.co.uk/showthread.php?t=191073&page=14&p=2943796#post2943796 tldr; I made about 12m an hour including ALL time spent, compared to my 7-8m an hour of mindless trading.  The difference? Major, for one, I was actually playing.  This Sothis smuggling is very engaging. More engaged than I have ever even been. Even CQC cannot match my engagement with smuggling. When you take on 12-20 smuggling missions, you have a LOT of people after you, interdicting you at a star, forcing you to burn up just to get out of there. You are met by not ONE pirate, but more like two, three, or four. Many of whom are just as fast or faster than 400m/s. For the next 45 minutes while you make the journey back to the bubble, it is a constant fight... and you kind of have to linger a bit to scoop fuel often. Sometimes you don't even get the chance to scoop before being interdicted, then you must decide to jump systems, or try to SC again and scoop. Each system leaves you open easily to many interdictions before even making it to the station. It's a wild, and very risky ride, in solo. In open, you are going to have a hell of a time just getting to a station in Sothis. I am an anaconda pilot, but I bought an asp for this. You need something that can do a decent cargo hold, jump 20ly on full cargo, and be medium sized. This relegates basically everyone to the almighty asp, putting a lot of people on the same playing field, which is kind of neat. You could use a Python, but that would make the most challenging part of the entire trip even harder, since you'd have to probably double the jumps and deal with double the interdictions, and probably be more likely to burn up. In the end, I see people yelling this is an exploit and needs a nerf, like rare trading back in the day. No way. In fact, we need MORE content just like this. It got me 500 LY out. I actually ranked up exploring, lmao. I've never even been that far out. You need a very high trade rank to actually even get anything close to 20m an hour. By high I mean at least Tycoon, but ideally Elite. By then, you have 400m or 1bil respectively, and earning 20M/hr based on your Elite rank and 1bil bank is more than fair. You might get lucky as a lower ranked trader, but if you keep doing this, I wager you will average more like 10M an hour.  10M an hour is a lot, but, bottom line, it's fair for the amount of challenge this is. There simply is no other equivalent content like this in the game. I take my Anaconda to the new Hazres sights, taking on wings of 3 Anacondas... and I don't break a sweat. There's no challenge. The only challenge is PvP, but if you outmatch people, they just run, or you meet a wing of 4 FDLs and clippers and someone wins or loses quickly. It's not really what I'd call fun. I broke a sweat yesterday after almost losing all my work multiple times. If you smuggle often enough with this method, you ARE going to die eventually. Even at 20M an hour, your best profits will be obtained in an ASP, not a battle tankaconda. You are about to engage in about 3-4 hours of some seriously challenging smuggling, with a high risk of actually losing it all 2 hours in with NO profits yet.  This was actually a lot of fun, it was very challenging, and I would say it was equally rewarding. Rares, back when they were clearly OP, were not a challenge at all. NPC interdictions were 100% avoidable, and you could mindlessly do the rare runs without any issues. By the time you were in an Anaconda or Type 9, with rares, you were able to make 100M+ an hour, with basically 0 risk. This is more like 10-15...maybe...and hour at most on average, highly risky, highly challenging, and a lot of fun. ED needs more stuff like this. What an awesome game. tldr; Sothis smuggling is 10-15m an hour realistically, unless you are an Elite ranked trader, at 1billion in profits already. It is very challenging, engaging, and actually quite fun."], "votes": ["41"], "title": ["ED should do content like this Sothis smuggling...more..."], "author": ["sentdex"]},

The righteous forum users are just seeing 20-40m an hour claims, admitting they haven't done it, but also calling for a nerf.

You were offered to deliver X cargo for Y credits per ton you could fit onto your ship.   This would solve problems two fold in Elite.  First, you can make better use of bigger transport ships for transport.  Second, it provides a greater risk-reward ratio in smuggling.  Sure you might want to load a hundred tons of cargo into your T6, but have fun silent running with a hundred tons of narcotics into a station.  Hope your thrusters are worth a damn. Or, take 32 tons in my Cobra and zip in like a bee and land quietly, with lower risk and lower payouts, but more and consistent money, and ability to flee from enemies.     Of course, these missions would vary in maximum amount and credits per ton, but I really would like to see my Asp get some use out of her for actual smuggling outside of rares and whatnot.

Since playing E:D and especially since I started flying the Asp with its godly FSD range I've been wondering about and being slightly bugged by the navigation list in the left panel cockpit computer, specifically which systems will show on the list.

However, when I go to Altair and it's neighbouring systems, the nav list is reduced to all stations up to only 15 ly's away. So far I haven't been able to find out where this difference comes from. Secondly, and I fear the answer to this will be negative, I'd like to know if there's a way to filter or extend the nav list somehow. I'm in an Asp which has been outfitted for trading and max FSD with no weapons and all but the essentials at D for reduced weight.

Elite in Explorer is around 155 million in exploration data, or over 3000 high value scans (black holes, neutron stars, etc). I don't even want to think about how many kills you need for Combat Elite. Players with Elite rank don't need high value rewards, the rest of us do so we actually have a hope in hell of getting there at some point. If it had anything to do with skill I might agree but this is just a grind we're talking about. I still contend the problem is with how pathetically poorly most other options pay, not with occasionally lucrative opportunities like this. Outside of smuggling, missions are utterly outclassed. Combat ones take too long to compete with bounty hunting and the rest pay insulting little. Trade does well but only in a very limited sense. Rares make a nice stepping stone but that's all; they start falling behind rapidly once you hit 100t of cargo. Bulk trading takes off around the same point but only if you trade a very short list of commodities on a great route. You're practically forced to use third party tools if you want to do more than dick around for hours with nothing to show for it. Hell, over 3/4 of the commodities in the game are so worthless for trade they might as well not be in the game!

This means it will take 23x longer than normal to charge. The numbers themselves are surely a little wonky. I think to some extent it has to do with how spread out the mass is, since the Anaconda is long but fairly narrow relative to the Clipper or T9 it has effectively more 'density' so it manages a very high mass lock factor.

I've also seen alot of questions being asked about what is it, how does it work. So i'm just writing a simple informative/guide piece about it to help others, if you feel something is missing add it in the comments! \u00a0 Why SOTHIS? SOTHIS is averaging 400 Ly's away from most other federation systems, and with nothing but empty space between SOTHIS and the other stations, it gives one of the highest rewarding smuggling missions. \u00a0 What do I need? http://coriolis.io/outfit/asp/05D5D5A4D4D5D5C------0002040405374002f30d2f.Iw18WQ==.Aw18WQ== \u00a0 You'll need to have a good trade rank to get more rewarding missions, Merchant or Broker is actually not bad, but the higher the better.  It's also useful but not necessary to have a good relation with the federation.  \u00a0 How much money can I make? It's not what it seems it isn't 50M per hour, I've found after some practice you can do around 30 - 40M every 2 Hours at a good pace and with some luck. \u00a0 Make a stop at CEOS which is right next to SOTHIS to pick up another couple of million in missions, You'll also make sometimes 200k just going from CEOS to SOTHIS \u00a0 If i'm honest it is still a silly amount comparing it to trading. I was doing 12.6M an hour with my conda compared to the average 15 - 20M an hour through this. \u00a0 Other rewards that people fail to mention You gain exploration experience if you scan all the systems as you go through point A to point B.  You gain trading experience everytime you hand in a mission You'll find that you'll frequently be given missions to rank you up in the federation. \u00a0 Is this a exploit? No. I don't think it's a exploit, I think that it needs to be re-balanced but it isn't a exploit. \u00a0 For re balancing we could put a maximum range for smuggling missions, and at a distance of X the maximum payout is Y, this would bring a balance to the game.

I'm a bit disappointed so I'm hoping I did my math wrong and somebody can point that out to me.

I mean the shutdown of the body would happen as result of \"me\" moving on to the new way of existance. That'd be also some sort of theoretical confirmation of the completion of the \"essence transfer\""], "hyperlink": ["https://www.reddit.com/r/EliteDangerous/comments/3op2tl/rivers_in_the_outer_rings_of_stations/cvzd89c"]},
